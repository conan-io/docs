Install
=======

Conan can be installed in many Operating Systems. It is extensively used and tested in Windows, Linux (different distributions),
OSX, and also actively used in FreeBSD and Solaris SunOS, but it has been reported to work in other systems too.

There are three ways to install conan:

1. The preferred and **strongly recommended way to install conan** is from PyPI, the Python Package Index,
   with the ``pip`` command.
2. There are other available installers for different systems, which might come with a bundled
   python interpreter, so it is not necessary to install python first. Please note that some of 
   **these installers might have some limitations**, specially those created with pyinstaller 
   (like Windows exe & Linux deb).
3. Running conan from sources.

Install with pip (recommended)
--------------------------------

You need a python 2.7 or 3.X distribution installed in your machine. Modern python distributions come
with pip pre-installed, if not, install pip following `pip docs`_

Install conan:

::

    $ pip install conan

.. note::

    **IMPORTANT: Please READ carefully**:

    - Please make sure that your **pip** installation matches your **python (2.7 or 3.X)** one.
    - In Linux if you want to install it globally, you might need **sudo** permissions.
    - We strongly recommend using **virtualenvs** (virtualenvwrapper works great) for everything python related
    - In **Windows** you might need to use **32bits** python distributions, instead of 64bits.
    - In **OSX**, specially latest versions that might have **System Integrity Protection**, pip might fail. Try with virtualenvs, or install with other user ``$ pip install --user conan``
    - If you are in Windows, and using python <3.5, you might have problems if python is installed in a path with spaces, like "C:/Program Files(x86)/Python". This is a known python limitation, not conan. Install python in a path without spaces, use a virtualenv in another location or upgrade your python installation


Install from brew (OSX)
-----------------------
There is a brew recipe, so in OSX, you can install conan with 

::

    $ brew update
    $ brew install conan
    
    
Install from AUR (Arch Linux)
-----------------------------
You can find the package `here <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/conan/>`_.
The easiest way is using **pacaur** tool:

::

    $ pacaur -S conan


Or you can also use ``makepkg`` and install it following the `AUR docs: installing packages <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository>`_.   

Just remember to install six conan dependencies first. They are not in the official 
repositories but there are in **AUR** repository too:

- python-patch 
- python-monotonic
- python-fasteners
- python-node-semver
- python-distro
- python-pluginbase


Install the binaries
--------------------

Go to the conan website and `download the installer for your platform <https://www.conan.io/downloads>`_!

Execute the installer. You don't need to install python.

.. note::

    You can also use the latest version's links to download the latest installer:

    :: 
    
        http://downloads.conan.io/latest_debian
        http://downloads.conan.io/latest_windows


Initial configuration
---------------------

Let's check if conan is correctly installed. Execute in your console:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conan

You will see something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   It seems to be the first time you run conan
   Auto detecting your dev setup to initialize conan.conf
   Found Visual Studio 9
   Found Visual Studio 12
   Found Visual Studio 14
   Found gcc 4.8
   Found clang 3.7
   Default conan.conf settings
           os=Windows
           arch=x86_64
           compiler=Visual Studio
           compiler.version=14
           compiler.runtime=MD
           build_type=Release
   *** You can change them in ~/.conan/conan.conf ***
   *** Or override with -s compiler='other' -s ...s***

As you can see, on first execution, conan performs a basic detection of your installed tools and
saves the details in the **conan.conf** file (under your user home directory **~/.conan/conan.conf**).
These auto-detected settings are just a convenience and act as a default for your conan commands.
You can change them at any time in this file or override them on the command line with new values.
You can also delete them from **conan.conf**, in which case you will have to fully specify them for
new projects.


Install from source
-------------------

You can run conan directly from source code. First you need to install Python 2.7 and pip.
From 0.9 conan has "experimental/testing" Python3 support too.

Clone (or download and unzip) the git repository and install its requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/conan-io/conan.git
    $ cd conan
    $ pip install -r conans/requirements.txt

Create a script to execute conan and add it to your ``PATH``.

.. code-block:: text

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import sys

    conan_repo_path = "/home/your_user/conan" # ABSOLUTE PATH TO CONAN REPOSITORY FOLDER

    sys.path.append(conan_repo_path)
    from conans.client.command import main
    main(sys.argv[1:])

Test your ``conan`` script.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan

You should see the conan commands help.
