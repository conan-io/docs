Consuming Packages
==================

In this section, we first show how to get started with Conan: declaring your dependencies
in a project, that can be libraries (like *zlib*, *openssl*, *boost*, etc.) or build tools (like
*CMake*, *msys2*, *MinGW*, etc.), how to build for different configurations (like Release, Debug,
Static, Shared, etc.). Also, how you can make a more advanced dependency declaration in your
projects using a *conanfile.py* to make things like conditional requirements.

Then you will learn... (TODO: versioning part)
