Creating packages
=================

This section shows how to create Conan packages using a Conan recipe. We begin by creating
a basic Conan recipe to package a simple C++ library that you can scaffold using the
:command:`conan new` command. Then, we will explain the different methods that you can
define inside a Conan recipe and the things you can do inside them:

* Using the ``source()`` method to retrieve sources from external repositories and apply
  patches to those sources.

* Add requirements to your Conan packages inside the ``requirements()`` method. 

* Use the ``generate()`` method to prepare the package build, and customize the toolchain.

* Configure settings and options in the ``configure()`` and ``config_options()``
  methods and how they affect the packages' binary compatibility.

* Use the ``build()`` method to customize the build process and launch the tests for the
  library you are packaging. 

* Select which files will be included in the Conan package using the ``package()`` method.

* Define the package information in the ``package_info()`` method so that consumers
  of this package can use it.

After this walkthrough around some Conan recipe methods, we will explain some
peculiarities of different types of Conan packages like, for example, header-only
libraries, packages for pre-built binaries, packaging tools for building other packages or
packaging your own applications.
