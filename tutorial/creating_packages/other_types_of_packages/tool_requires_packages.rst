Tool requires packages
======================

In the ":ref:`Using build tools as Conan packages <consuming_packages_tool_requires>`" section we learned how to use
a tool require to build (or help building) our project or Conan package.
In this section we are going to learn how to create a recipe for a tool require.

.. note::

    **Best practice**

    ``tool_requires`` and tool packages are intended for executable applications, like ``cmake`` or ``ninja`` that
    can be used as ``tool_requires("cmake/[>=3.25]")`` by other packages to put those executables in their path. They
    are not intended for library-like dependencies (use ``requires`` for them), for test frameworks (use ``test_requires``)
    or in general for anything that belongs to the "host" context of the final application. Do not abuse ``tool_requires``
    for other purposes.
    

Please, first clone the sources to recreate this project. You can find them in the
`examples2.0 repository <https://github.com/conan-io/examples2>`_ on GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/conan-io/examples2.git
    $ cd examples2/tutorial/creating_packages/other_packages/tool_requires/tool


A simple tool require recipe
----------------------------

This is a recipe for a (fake) application that receiving a path returns 0 if the path is secure.
We can check how the following simple recipe covers most of the ``tool-require`` use-cases:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    import os
    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMake, cmake_layout
    from conan.tools.files import copy


    class secure_scannerRecipe(ConanFile):
        name = "secure_scanner"
        version = "1.0"
        package_type = "application"

        # Binary configuration
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"

        # Sources are located in the same place as this recipe, copy them to the recipe
        exports_sources = "CMakeLists.txt", "src/*"

        def layout(self):
            cmake_layout(self)

        def generate(self):
            tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
            tc.generate()

        def build(self):
            cmake = CMake(self)
            cmake.configure()
            cmake.build()

        def package(self):
            extension = ".exe" if self.settings_build.os == "Windows" else ""
            copy(self, "*secure_scanner{}".format(extension),
                 self.build_folder, os.path.join(self.package_folder, "bin"), keep_path=False)

        def package_info(self):
            self.buildenv_info.define("MY_VAR", "23")


There are few relevant things in this recipe:

1. It declares ``package_type = "application"``, this is optional but convenient, it will indicate conan that the current
   package doesn't contain headers or libraries to be linked. The consumers will know that this package is an application.

2. The ``package()`` method is packaging the executable into the ``bin/`` folder, that is declared by default as a bindir:
   ``self.cpp_info.bindirs = ["bin"]``.

3. In the ``package_info()`` method, we are using ``self.buildenv_info`` to define a environment variable ``MY_VAR``
   that will also be available in the consumer.


Let's create a binary package for the tool_require:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan create .
    ...
    secure_scanner/1.0: Calling package()
    secure_scanner/1.0: Copied 1 file: secure_scanner
    secure_scanner/1.0 package(): Packaged 1 file: secure_scanner
    ...
    Security Scanner: The path 'mypath' is secure!


Let's review the ``test_package/conanfile.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan import ConanFile


    class secure_scannerTestConan(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"

        def build_requirements(self):
            self.tool_requires(self.tested_reference_str)

        def test(self):
            extension = ".exe" if self.settings_build.os == "Windows" else ""
            self.run("secure_scanner{} mypath".format(extension))


We are requiring the ``secure_scanner`` package as ``tool_require`` doing ``self.tool_requires(self.tested_reference_str)``.
In the ``test()`` method we are running the application, because it is available in the PATH. In the
next example we are going to see why the executables from a ``tool_require`` are available in the consumers.

So, let's create a consumer recipe to test if we can run the ``secure_scanner`` application of the ``tool_require`` and
read the environment variable. Go to the `examples2/tutorial/creating_packages/other_packages/tool_requires/consumer`
folder:


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    from conan import ConanFile

    class MyConsumer(ConanFile):
        name = "my_consumer"
        version = "1.0"
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        tool_requires = "secure_scanner/1.0"

        def build(self):
            extension = ".exe" if self.settings_build.os == "Windows" else ""
            self.run("secure_scanner{} {}".format(extension, self.build_folder))
            if self.settings_build.os != "Windows":
                self.run("echo MY_VAR=$MY_VAR")
            else:
                self.run("set MY_VAR")


In this simple recipe we are declaring a ``tool_require`` to ``secure_scanner/1.0`` and we are calling directly the packaged
application ``secure_scanner`` in the ``build()`` method, also printing the value of the ``MY_VAR`` env variable.

If we build the consumer:


.. code-block:: bash


    $ conan build .

    -------- Installing (downloading, building) binaries... --------
    secure_scanner/1.0: Already installed!

    -------- Finalizing install (deploy, generators) --------
    ...
    conanfile.py (my_consumer/1.0): RUN: secure_scanner /Users/luism/workspace/examples2/tutorial/creating_packages/other_packages/tool_requires/consumer
    ...
    Security Scanner: The path '/Users/luism/workspace/examples2/tutorial/creating_packages/other_packages/tool_requires/consumer' is secure!
    ...
    MY_VAR=23


We can see that the executable returned 0 (because our folder is secure) and it printed ``Security Scanner: The path is secure!`` message.
It also printed the "23" value assigned to ``MY_VAR`` but, why are these automatically available?

- The generators ``VirtualBuildEnv`` and ``VirtualRunEnv`` are automatically used.
- The ``VirtualRunEnv`` is reading the ``tool-requires`` and is creating a launcher like ``conanbuildenv-release-x86_64.sh`` appending
  all ``cpp_info.bindirs`` to the ``PATH``, all the ``cpp_info.libdirs`` to the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable and
  declaring each variable of ``self.buildenv_info``.
- Every time conan executes the ``self.run``, by default, activates the ``conanbuild.sh`` file before calling any command.
  The ``conanbuild.sh`` is including the ``conanbuildenv-release-x86_64.sh``, so the application is in the PATH
  and the enviornment variable "MYVAR" has the value declared in the tool-require.


Removing settings in package_id()
---------------------------------

With the previous recipe, if we call :command:`conan create` with different setting like different compiler versions, we will get
different binary packages with a different ``package ID``. This might be convenient to, for example, keep better traceability of
our tools. In this case, the :ref:`compatibility.py<reference_extensions_binary_compatibility>` plugin can help to locate the best matching binary in case Conan doesn't find the
binary for our specific compiler version.

But in some cases we might want to just generate a binary taking into account only the ``os``, ``arch`` or at most
adding the ``build_type`` to know if the application is built for Debug or Release. We can add a ``package_id()`` method
to remove them:


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    import os
    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMake, cmake_layout
    from conan.tools.files import copy


    class secure_scannerRecipe(ConanFile):
        name = "secure_scanner"
        version = "1.0"
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
        ...

        def package_id(self):
            del self.info.settings.compiler
            del self.info.settings.build_type


So, if we call :command:`conan create` with different ``build_type`` we will get exactly the same ``package_id``.


.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan create .
    ...
    Package '82339cc4d6db7990c1830d274cd12e7c91ab18a1' created

    $ conan create . -s build_type=Debug
    ...
    Package '82339cc4d6db7990c1830d274cd12e7c91ab18a1' created

We got the same binary ``package_id``. The second ``conan create . -s build_type=Debug`` created and overwrote (created a newer package revision) of the previous Release binary, because they have the same ``package_id`` identifier. It is typical to create only the ``Release`` one, and if for any reason managing both Debug and Release binaries is intended, then the approach would be not removing the ``del self.info.settings.build_type``
