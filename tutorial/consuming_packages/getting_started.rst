Getting started
===============

This section shows how to build your projects using Conan to manage your dependencies. We
will begin with basic example of a C project that uses CMake and depends on the **zlib**
library. This project will use a *conanfile.txt* file to declare it's dependencies.

We will also cover how you can not only use 'regular' libraries with Conan but also manage
tools you may need to use while building: like CMake, msys2, MinGW, etc. 

Then, we will explain different Conan concepts like settings and options and how you can
use them to build your projects for different configurations like Debug, Release, with
static or shared libraries, etc. 

Also, we will explain how to transition from the *conanfile.txt* file we used in the first
example to a more powerful conanfile.py.
