.. _consuming_packages_cross_building_with_conan:

How to cross-compile your applications using Conan: host and build contexts
===========================================================================

.. important::

    In this example, we will retrieve Conan packages from a Conan repository with
    packages compatible with Conan 2.0. To run this example successfully you should add this
    remote to your Conan configuration (if did not already do it) doing:
    ``conan remote add conanv2 https://conanv2beta.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/conan/conan --index 0``


Please, first clone the sources to recreate this project. You can find them in the
`examples2.0 repository <https://github.com/conan-io/examples2>`_ on GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/conan-io/examples2.git
    $ cd examples2/tutorial/consuming_packages/cross_building


In the previous examples, we learned how to use a *conanfile.py* or *conanfile.txt* to
build an application that compresses strings using the *Zlib* and *CMake* Conan packages.
Also, we explained that you can set information like the operating system, compiler or
build configuration in a file called the Conan profile. You can use that profile as an
argument (:command:`--profile`) to invoke the :command:`conan install`. We also explained that
not specifying that profile is equivalent to using the :command:`--profile=default` argument.

For all those examples, we used the same platform for building and running the
application. But, what if you want to build the application on your machine running Ubuntu
Linux and then run it on another platform like a
Raspberry Pi? Conan can model that case using two different profiles, one for the
machine that **builds** the application (Ubuntu Linux) and another for the machine that
**runs** the application (Raspberry Pi). We will explain this "two profiles" approach in
the next section.

Conan two profiles model: build and host profiles
-------------------------------------------------

Even if you specify only one :command:`--profile` argument when invoking Conan, Conan will
internally use two profiles. One for the machine that **builds** the binaries (called the
**build** profile) and another for the machine that **runs** those binaries (called the
**host** profile). Calling this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install . --build=missing --profile=someprofile

Is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install . --build=missing --profile:host=someprofile --profile:build=default


As you can see we used two new arguments:

* ``profile:host``: This is the profile that defines the platform where the built binaries
  will run. For our string compressor application this profile would be the one applied
  for the *Zlib* library that will run in a **Raspberry Pi**.
* ``profile:build``: This is the profile that defines the platform where the binaries will be built. For our string compressor application, this profile would be the one
  used by the *CMake* tool that will compile it on the **Ubuntu Linux** machine.

Note that when you just use one argument for the profile ``--profile`` is equivalent to
``--profile:host``. If you don't specify the ``--profile:build`` argument, Conan will use
the *default* profile internally.

So, if we want to build the compressor application in the Ubuntu Linux machine but run it
in a Raspberry Pi, we should use two different profiles. For the **build** machine we
could use the default profile, that in our case looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: <conan home>/profiles/default

    [settings]
    os=Linux
    arch=x86_64
    build_type=Release
    compiler=gcc
    compiler.cppstd=gnu14
    compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
    compiler.version=9

And the profile for the Raspberry Pi that is the **host** machine:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: <local folder>/profiles/raspberry
    :emphasize-lines: 9-12

    [settings]
    os=Linux
    arch=armv7hf
    compiler=gcc
    build_type=Release
    compiler.cppstd=gnu14
    compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
    compiler.version=9
    [buildenv]
    CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-9
    CXX=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++-9
    LD=arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld

.. important::

    Please, take into account that in order to build this example successfully, you should
    have installed a toolchain that includes the compiler and all the tools to build the
    application for the proper architecture. In this case the host machine is a Raspberry
    Pi 3 with *armv7hf* architecture operating system and we have the
    *arm-linux-gnueabihf* toolchain installed in the Ubuntu machine.

If you have a look at the *raspberry* profile, there is a section named
``[buildenv]``. This section is used to set the environment variables that are needed to
build the application. In this case we declare the ``CC``, ``CXX`` and ``LD`` variables
pointing to the cross-build toolchain compilers and linker, respectively. Adding this
section to the profile will invoke the VirtualBuildEnv generator everytime we do a
:command:`conan install`. This generator will add that environment information to the
``conanbuild.sh`` script that we will source before building with CMake so that it can use
the cross-build toolchain.

Build and host contexts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we have our two profiles prepared, let's have a look at our *conanfile.py*:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: **conanfile.py**

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.cmake import cmake_layout

    class CompressorRecipe(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
        generators = "CMakeToolchain", "CMakeDeps"

        def requirements(self):
            self.requires("zlib/1.2.11")
            self.tool_requires("cmake/3.19.8")

        def layout(self):
            cmake_layout(self)

As you can see, this is practically the same *conanfile.py* we used in the :ref:`previous
example<consuming_packages_flexibility_of_conanfile_py>`. We will require **zlib/1.2.11**
as a regular dependency and **cmake/3.19.8** as a tool needed for building the
application.

We will need the application to build for the Raspberry Pi with the cross-build
toolchain and also link the **zlib/1.2.11** library built for the same platform. On the
other side, we need the **cmake/3.19.8** binary to run in Ubuntu Linux. Conan manages this
internally in the dependency graph differentiating between what we call the "build
context" and the "host context":

* The **host context** is populated with the root package (the one specified in the
  :command:`conan install` or :command:`conan create` command) and all its requirements
  added via ``self.requires()``. In this case, this includes the compressor application
  and the **zlib/1.2.11** dependency.

* The **build context** contains the tool requirements used in the build machine. This
  category typically includes all the developer tools like CMake, compilers and linkers.
  In this case, this includes the **cmake/3.19.8** tool.


These contexts define how Conan will manage each one of the dependencies. For example, as
**zlib/1.2.11** belongs to the **host context**, the ``[buildenv]`` build environment we
defined in the **raspberry** profile (profile host) will only apply to the **zlib/1.2.11**
library when building and won't affect anything that belongs to the **build context** like
the **cmake/3.19.8** dependency.

Now, let's build the application. First, call :command:`conan install` with the
profiles for the build and host platforms. This will install the  **zlib/1.2.11**
dependency built for *armv7hf* architecture and a **cmake/3.19.8** version that runs for
64-bit architecture.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ conan install . --build missing -pr:b=default -pr:h=./profiles/raspberry

Then, let's call CMake to build the application. As we did in the previous example we have
to activate the **build environment** running ``source generators/conanbuild.sh``. That will
set the environment variables needed to locate the cross-build toolchain and build the
application.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd build
    $ source generators/conanbuild.sh
    Capturing current environment in deactivate_conanbuildenv-release-armv7hf.sh
    Configuring environment variables    
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=generators/conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ cmake --build .
    ...
    -- Conan toolchain: C++ Standard 14 with extensions ON
    -- The C compiler identification is GNU 9.4.0
    -- Detecting C compiler ABI info
    -- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
    -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-9 - skipped
    -- Detecting C compile features
    -- Detecting C compile features - done    [100%] Built target compressor
    ...
    $ source generators/deactivate_conanbuild.sh

You could check that we built the application for the correct architecture by running the
``file`` Linux utility:

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    $ file compressor
    compressor: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically
    linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3,
    BuildID[sha1]=2a216076864a1b1f30211debf297ac37a9195196, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not
    stripped
