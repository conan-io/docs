Introduction
============

Open Source
-----------

Conan is OSS, with an MIT license. Check out the source code and issue tracking (for reporting bugs
and for feature requests) at https://github.com/conan-io/conan

Decentralized package manager
-----------------------------

Conan is a decentralized package manager with a client-server architecture. This means that clients
can fetch packages from, as well as upload packages to, different servers (“remotes”), similar to
the “git” push-pull model to/from git remotes.

On a high level, the servers are just package storage. They do not build nor create the packages.
The packages are created by the client, and if binaries are built from sources, that compilation is
also done by the client application.

The different applications in the image above are:

- The **conan client**: this is a console/terminal command line application, containing the heavy
  logic for package creation and consumption. Conan client has a local cache for package storage,
  and so it allows you to fully create and test packages offline.  You can also **work offline** so
  long as no new packages are needed from remote servers.
- The **conan server**: this is a TCP server that can be easily run as your **own server
  on-premises** to host your private packages. It is also a service application that can be run as a
  daemon or service, behind a web server (apache, nginx), or easily as stand-alone application. Both
  the conan client and the conan_server are OSS, MIT license, so you can use them for free in your
  company, customize them, or redistribute them without any legal issue.
- **JFrog** `Artifactory <https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/>`_ offers conan repositories; so it can
  also be used as an on-premises server. It is a more powerful solution, featuring a WebUI, multiple
  auth protocols, High Availability, etc. It also has cloud offerings that will allow you to have
  private packages without having any on-premises infrastructure.
- **JFrog** `Bintray <https://bintray.com/>`_ provides a public and free hosting service for OSS
  conan packages. Users can create their own repositories under their accounts and organizations,
  and freely upload conan packages there, without moderation. You should, however, take into account
  that those packages will be public, and so they must conform to the respective licenses,
  especially if the packages contain third party code. Just reading or retrieving conan packages
  from Bintray, doesn't require an account, an account is only needed to upload packages. Besides
  that, Bintray provides a central repository called `conan-center
  <https://bintray.com/conan/conan-center>`_ which is moderated, and packages are reviewed before
  being accepted to ensure quality. This repository is currently empty, the process has just
  started. In the meantime, the repository `conan-transit
  <https://bintray.com/conan/conan-transit>`_ contains a copy of all the packages that were in the
  conan.io repository, and were copied. Those were non-moderated packages, so quality and
  cross-platform support of packages might vary.

Binary management
-----------------

One of the most powerful features of Conan is that it can manage pre-compiled binaries for packages. To
define a package, referenced by its name, version, user and channel, a package recipe is needed.
Such a package recipe is a conanfile.py python script that defines how the package is built from
sources, what the final binary artifacts are, the package dependencies, etc.

When a package recipe is used in the Conan client, and a “binary package” is built from sources, that
binary package will be compatible with specific settings, such as the OS it was created for, the
compiler and compiler version, or the computer architecture. If the package is built again from the
same sources but with different settings, (e.g. for a different architecture), a new, different
binary will be generated. By the way, “binary package” is in quotes because, strictly, it is not
necessarily a binary. A header-only library, for example, will contain just the headers in the
“binary package”.

All the binary packages generated from a package recipe are managed and stored coherently. When they
are uploaded to a remote, they stay connected. Also, different clients building binaries from the
same package recipe (like CI build slaves in different operating systems), will upload their
binaries under the same package name to the remotes.

Package consumers (client application users that are installing existing packages to reuse in their
projects) will typically retrieve pre-compiled binaries for their systems in case such compatible
binaries exist. Otherwise those packages will be built from sources on the client machine to create
a binary package matching their settings.

Cross platform, build system agnostic
-------------------------------------

Conan works and is being actively used on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, ArchLinux,
Raspbian), OSX, FreeBSD, and SunOS, and, as it is portable, it might work in any other platform that
can run python. In the documentation, examples for a specific OS might be found, such as
``conan install . -s compiler="Visual Studio"``, which will be specific for Windows users. If on a
different system, the reader should adapt to their own platform and settings (for example ``conan
install . -s compiler=gcc``).

Also **conan works with any build system**. In the documentation, CMake will be widely used, because
it is portable and well known. But conan does not depend on CMake at all; it is not a requirement.
**Conan is totally orthogonal to the build system**. There are some utilities that improve the usage
of popular build systems such as CMake or Autotools, but they are just helpers. Furthermore, it is
not necessary that all the packages are built with the same build system. It is possible to depend
on packages created with other build system than the one you are using to build your project.
