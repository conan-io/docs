.. caution::

    We are actively working to finalize the *Conan 2.0 Release*. Some of the information on this page references
    **deprecated** features which will not be carried forward with the new release. It's important to check the 
    :ref:`Migration Guidelines<conan2_migration_guide>` to ensure you are using the most up to date features.


Single-Page Graphical Format
============================

JFrog has created the following visual cheatsheet for basic Conan commands and
concepts which users can print out and use as a handy reference. It is available
as both a PDF and PNG.

Community-Created Format 
========================

Community contributors have also created the following extended cheatsheet
providing a more narrative and workflow-centric cheatsheet. It is effectively, a
single-page summary of other docs pages which community users found most
relevant to daily Conan operations.

Setup and configuration
-----------------------

Installation
++++++++++++

Conan is available as a Python package, and the recommended way to install is via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install conan
    $ pip install conan --upgrade

There are `other methods of installation <https://conan.io/downloads.html>`_ available, including standalone installers,
which don't require a Python installation.

See `Install <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ docs.

Configurations
++++++++++++++

Configurations contain hooks_, profiles_, `remote repositories`_ and settings_, making them available for builds once
installed. They are installed from a folder, zip, URL or git repo, and the installed items are recorded in
~/.conan/conan.conf.

Install configurations:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan config install <item>  # Copy the relevant contents from <item> to the user's ~/.conan directory.

    $ conan config install ./my_config.conf

Alternatively, copying files and editing conan.conf can be done manually.

Set up configurations:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan config init     # Initialize Conan configuration files. If some are already present, missing files only are
                            # created

Set configuration values:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan config set <section>.<config>=<value>

    $ conan config set log.level=10
    $ conan config set log.print_run_commands=False  # Make conan less verbose

Inspect configurations:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan config home     # See the Conan home directory

    $ conan config get [<section>.<config>]  # Show some or all configuration items

    $ conan config get                       # Show the full conan.conf file
    $ conan config get log.level             # Show the "level" item in the "log" section

See `conan config <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/consumer/config.html>`_ reference.

Profiles
++++++++

Profiles allow users to set aspects of the build configuration. This includes settings_, options_, environment variables
and tool requirements. They can be installed into ~/.conan/profiles. They can also be stored in project directories,
which can be useful for specific compilation cases, for example cross-compiling.

Profiles are stored in text files with no file extension. An example profile:

.. code-block:: text

    CROSS_GCC=arm-linux-gnueabihf

    include(default)              # Can include other configurations, for example the default configuration

    [settings]
    os=Linux
    compiler=gcc
    compiler.version=6
    compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
    build_type=Release
    arch=armv7
    os_build=Linux
    arch_build=x86_64
    OpenSSL:compiler.version=4.8  # Dependency-specific value

    [options]
    shared=True

    [env]                         # Environment variables
    CC=$CROSS_GCC-gcc             # Strings can be defined and substituted
    CXX=$CROSS_GCC-g++

    [tool_requires]               # Requirements for package builds only
    cmake/3.16.3                  # Specifying tool requirements here rather than in the recipe makes them less binding

List profiles:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan profile list

Show a profile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan profile show <profile>

    $ conan profile show default

Use profile while executing command (e.g., ``conan install`` or ``conan create``):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan <command> . -pr=<profile1> -pr=<profile2>  # Use installed profile name, or file path
                                                       # Composable, last -pr wins for conflicts

See `conan profile <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/misc/profile.html>`_ reference.

Remote repositories
+++++++++++++++++++

Conan Center is configured by default.

List configured remotes:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan remote list

Add remote:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan remote add <remote ID> <URL of remote repo>

See `conan remote <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/misc/remote.html>`_ reference.

Consuming packages
------------------

Using packages in an application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Write a conanfile.txt. This captures the project configuration:

.. code-block:: text

    [requires]                     # The Conan packages which are used in the application
    boost/1.72.0                   # Versions override versions upstream in the dependency graph
    poco/1.9.4

    [tool_requires]                # The Conan packages which are used to build the application
    7zip/16.00

    [generators]                   # Generators create build system files that capture the dependency information,
    cmake                          # as well as configuration information from Conan settings and options

    [options]                      # Options here override options upstream in the dependency graph
    boost:shared=True              # Options can be specified on a per-package basis for dependencies
    poco:shared=True

    [imports]                      # Copies files from the cache to the current working directory
    bin, *.dll -> ./bin            # Copies all .dll files from the packages' bin/ folder to the local bin/ folder

2. Get dependencies and generate build system files via ``conan install``

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install . [-o <package>:<option>=<value>]  # Specify options, e.g. shared=True
                      [-s <package>:<setting>=<value>] # Specify settings, e.g. build_type=Debug
                                                       # <package> is optional: if not specified, the option/setting
                                                       # applies to all dependencies
                      [-r=<remote ID>]                 # Download dependencies from only the specified remote
                      [-g=<generator>]                 # Specify generators at the command line

3. #include interface files to the Conan packages in the source code
4. Modify the build system to use the files output from the Generator
5. Build the application using the build system

Downloading packages
++++++++++++++++++++

Download a package, if it isn't already in `the local cache`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install <package>/<version>@[<user>/<channel>#<revision>]
                    [-r=<remote ID>]                                    # Download dependencies from only the specified remote


    $ conan install .  # Install a package requirement from a conanfile.txt, saved in your current directory, with all
                       # options and settings coming from your default profile

    $ conan install . -o pkg_name:use_debug_mode=on -s compiler=clang   # As above, but override one option and one
                                                                        # setting

See `conan install <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/consumer/install.html>`_ reference.

The local cache
+++++++++++++++

The local package cache is located at ~/.conan/data by default (but this is configurable).

Clear packages from cache:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan remove "<package>" --force  # <package> can include wildcards

    $ conan remove 'boost/*'                     # Remove all versions of Boost
    $ conan remove 'mypackage/1.2@user/channel'  # Remove all revisions of mypackage/1.2@user/channel

See `conan remove <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/misc/remove.html>`_ reference.

Using packages as standalone applications
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Packages can either be copied to the local project folder and run from there, or run directly from the local cache.

In the `conanfile.txt`__, this can be done in the [imports] or [generators] section. See below for the relevant
generators. In `the package recipe`_, this can be done using the ``imports()`` or ``deploy()`` methods.

__ #using-conan-packages-in-an-application

Prepare packages for use via the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install . -g=deploy         # Copy dependencies to current folder
    $ conan install . -g=virtualrunenv  # Create shell scripts to activate and deactivate environments where you can run
                                        # dependencies from the local cache

Searching and introspecting packages
------------------------------------

Searching packages
++++++++++++++++++

Recipes and binaries can be searched in the local cache or remotes.

List names of packages in local cache:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search              # List names of packages in local cache

Show package recipes or builds of a package:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search <package>/<revision>@<user>/<channel>  # Output depends on how much of a package reference is given.
                                                          # Wildcards are supported
                   [--table=file.html]                    # Save output in an HTML file
                   [-r=<remote>]                          # Look in a remote repository (default is the local cache)

    $ conan search mylib/1.0@user/channel                 # Show all packages of mylib/1.0@user/channel in the local cache
    $ conan search "zlib/*" -r=all                        # Show all versions of zlib in all remotes

Show revisions of a package:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search <package>/<revision>@<user>/<channel> --revisions

See `conan search <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/consumer/search.html>`_ reference.

Inspecting packages
+++++++++++++++++++

Print the package recipe in full:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan get <package>/<revision>@<user>/<channel>

    $ conan get boost/1.74.0

Print attributes of the package recipe:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan inspect <package>/<revision>@<user>/<channel>

    $ conan inspect boost/1.74.0

See `conan get <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/consumer/get.html>`_ and `conan
inspect <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/misc/inspect.html>`_ reference.

Visualizing dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Show a dependency graph for the package or application:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan info . [--graph=file.html]  # Save output in an HTML file

See `conan info <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/consumer/info.html>`_ reference.

Creating packages
-----------------

Package terminology
+++++++++++++++++++

Each package recipe relates to a single package. However, a package can be built in different ways.

A reference is used to identify packages:

.. code-block:: text

    <package>/<version>@<user>/<channel>#RREV:PACKAGE_ID#PREV

The recipe reference is used to identify a certain version of a recipe:

.. code-block:: text

    <package>/<version>@<user>/<channel>  # <package> and <version> are defined in the recipe; <user> and <channel> are
                                          # defined by the user when exporting the package

    lib/1.0@conan/stable


The package ID is a SHA-1 hash calculated from the build options_ and settings_ and from dependencies (according to
certain modes__).

__ #package-id-calculation-modes

See `Revisions`_ for further details of the recipe revision and package revision (RREV and PREV).

Creating a basic package
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a template package:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan new <package>/<version>@[<user>/<channel>]  # <user>/<channel> is not specified in Conan Center, but otherwise they should be
                [-t]                                    # Create a recipe for a basic test to verify the package was created successfully
                [-s]                                    # Create a recipe/source template for a package with local source code

Build a package from a `recipe`__ and store it in the local cache:

__ #the-package-recipe

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan create . <user>/<channel> [-o <package>:<option>=<value>]   # Specify options, for example shared=True.
                                      [-s <package>:<setting>=<value>]  # Specify settings, for example build_type=Debug.
                                                                        # If <package> is not specified, the option and
                                                                        # setting applies to all dependencies.
                                      [-pr=<profile name>]              # If -pr is not specified, the default profile is used
                                      [--build=missing]                 # Build all dependencies if they can't be downloaded

See `conan new <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/creator/new.html>`_ and `conan
create <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/creator/create.html>`_ reference.

The package recipe
++++++++++++++++++

A package recipe is a Python class, defined in a file called conanfile.py:

.. code-block:: python

    class MypackageConan(ConanFile):
        ...                                                # Various package metadata
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"  # Defines available settings
        options = {"shared": [True, False]}                # Defines available options and defaults. "shared" is a common
                                                           # option which specifies whether a library is static or shared

        default_options = {"shared": False}
        requires = "requiredlib/0.1@user/stable"           # Defines package requirements
        tool_requires = "tool_a/0.2@user/testing"          # Defines requirements that are only used when the package is
                                                           # built. These should be build and test tools only
        generators = "cmake"                               # Generator for the package: specifies which build system
                                                           # type will be generated

        def source(self):                                                # Obtains the source code for the project
            self.run("git clone https://github.com/conan-io/hello.git")  # self.run() executes any command in the native shell
            tools.get("https://github.com/conan-io/hello/" +             # tools.get() downloads, unzips, and then removes the .zip file
                      "archive/refs/heads/master.zip")                   # The tools module contains a lot of helper methods for common
            ...                                                          # tasks, and using them is often preferable to using self.run()
                                                                         # See the link below for more information

            if self.options.myoption2:                                   # Specify a conditional requirement
                self.requires("requiredlib2/0.3@user/stable")

Python requires
###############

Python requires allow the re-use of python code across multiple recipes. Complex dependency graphs can be produced,
and the `same concepts`__ apply with python requires as with normal package requirements.

__ #managing-dependencies

Export a conanfile.py:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan export . <user>/<channel>

Use the exported conanfile.py:

.. code-block:: python

   class ConsumerConan(ConanFile):
       python_requires = "<package>/<version>@<user>/<channel>"  # To use functions and variables from the exported conanfile.py
       python_requires_extend = "<package>.<base class name>"    # To inherit from a full class in the exported conanfile.py

           ...
           self.python_requires["<package>"].module.func()           # To call the method func() from the exported conanfile.py

See `conan export <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/creator/export.html>`_ reference.

Hooks
#####

Hooks are recipe methods which are defined globally. They should not affect the built binary. There are ``pre`` and
``post`` hooks for many methods in the recipe. Hooks reside in ~/.conan/hooks, and are include in ~/.conan/conan.conf
under the [hooks] section. 

Install a hook:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan config install  # In the directory containing the python script with the hook

Specifying build configuration items
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Settings
########

Settings are configuration items which generally apply to all builds of all packages in the dependency tree.
`compiler`, `os`, `arch`, and `build_type` (`Release`/`Debug`) are some of the most common.

Available settings are defined in a global settings file: ~/.conan/settings.yml. The settings for a given package are
defined in `the package recipe`_.

Settings can then be set via profiles_ or via arguments to `conan install`__ or `conan create`__.

__ #using-conan-packages-in-an-application
__ #creating-a-basic-package

Options
#######

Options are configuration items which are generally package-specific.

The available options for a package are defined in `the package recipe`_.

Options can then be set via profiles_, an application's `Conanfile.txt`__, or via arguments to `conan install`__ or
`conan create`__.

Versioning
++++++++++

Versions
########

Packages are specified whenever a package is created, and whenever a recipe is consumed via a recipe reference.

Specify ranges:

.. code-block:: text

    [>min_ver <max_ver] - specify a version range
    [*]                 - specify any version
    [~maj.min]          - specify any patch in v[maj].[min]

The version taken is otherwise the maximum available.

Revisions
#########

Revisions allow changes to a package without increasing the version number or overwriting the existing version number.
They are disabled by default.

There are two types of revisions:

- "Recipe Revisions" (RREV) - Revision of the recipe and sources
- "Package Revisions" (PREV) - Revision of a binary package

The recipe revision (RREV) is a SHA-1 hash calculated over the `conan_manifest.txt`, which contains the individual
hashes of the `conanfile.py` and all the files exported with `exports` and `exports_sources`. If the `scm` feature is
used, Conan can also formulate the recipe revision directly from the version control system. Conan only holds one recipe
revision in the local cache. Many recipe revisions can be stored in remote repositories. This helps differentiate
between packages that have been changed and built without changing the version number. Recipe revisions can be specified
wherever a recipe is consumed. If a recipe revision is not specified, the latest revision is used.

The package revision (PREV) is a SHA-1 hash calculated over the binary contents of the package directory after the build
and package steps are completed. Package revisions provide the most precise identification for a built package. They are
very rarely used directly by users in commands or configurations, because it's fairly impactical to do so. Instead, they
are generally managed by the use of "Lockfiles". 

Enable revisions:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan config set general.revisions_enabled=True

Managing dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++

Specifying dependencies
#######################

Main application dependencies are set in the [requires] section of `Conanfile.txt`__.

__ #using-conan-packages-in-an-application

Package dependencies - normal requirements, tool requirements, conditional requirements - are set in `the package recipe`_.

Package ID calculation modes
############################

Conan performs dependency resolution via the calculation of package IDs. A package ID is calculated for a desired
dependency, and then Conan searches for that package ID.

The package ID calculation, and therefore the dependency resolution, is affected by the default_package_id_mode and the
default_python_requires_id_mode. They determine what exactly affects the calculation: which parts of version numbers;
package revisions; immediate or transitive dependencies. This relates to both normal requirements and `Python
requires`_. By default, only the main version number of direct dependencies are taken into account when calculating the
package ID.

These modes can be set in the [general] section of configurations_, and in `the package recipe`_.

Resolving dependency conflicts
##############################

Versions defined in the `conanfile.txt`__ take precedence over versions specified by dependencies. This can be used to
resolve conflicts by dictating the use of only one version throughout the whole dependency graph.

__ #using-conan-packages-in-an-application

Lockfiles
#########

Lockfiles allow a snapshot of a dependency graph used for a build to be taken, and the build to be reproduced exactly at
a later time.

Create a lockfile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan lock create <package>/conanfile.py --user=<user> --channel=<channel>

Use lockfile during ``conan create`` or ``conan install``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan <command> --lockfile conan.lock

See `conan lock <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/misc/lock.html>`_ reference.

Uploading packages to a remote repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Packages are not uploaded to a remote repository automatically. This needs to be done manually.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan upload "<package>" -r <remote ID>  # Wildcards can be specified to upload multiple packages
                   [--all]                     # Upload all binaries and their recipes (recipes only uploaded by default)
                   [--confirm]                 # Auto-confirm

See `conan upload <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/creator/upload.html>`_ reference.

Important points for enterprises
--------------------------------

Versioning, revisioning and dependency resolution should be consistent across a company. Configurations_ should be
synchronised across all developers, in particular `package id calculation modes`_.

In a CI/CD system, use lockfiles_ throughout, so that builds are reproducible.
