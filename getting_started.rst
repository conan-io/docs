Getting started
===============

As an example, let's start with one of the most popular C++ libraries: POCO_.
Conan **works with any build system** and it does not depend on CMake, though we will use CMake for
this example for convenience.

.. _POCO: https://pocoproject.org/

A Timer using POCO libraries
----------------------------

First, let's create a folder for our project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir mytimer
    $ cd mytimer

.. note::

    If you have the code in a github repository, instead of creating the folder, you can just clone
    the project:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
       $ git clone https://github.com/memsharded/example-poco-timer.git mytimer

Create the following source files inside that folder:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :caption: **timer.cpp**

    // $Id: //poco/1.4/Foundation/samples/Timer/src/Timer.cpp#1 $
    // This sample demonstrates the Timer and Stopwatch classes.
    // Copyright (c) 2004-2006, Applied Informatics Software Engineering GmbH.
    // and Contributors.
    // SPDX-License-Identifier:    BSL-1.0

    #include "Poco/Timer.h"
    #include "Poco/Thread.h"
    #include "Poco/Stopwatch.h"
    #include <iostream>

    using Poco::Timer;
    using Poco::TimerCallback;
    using Poco::Thread;
    using Poco::Stopwatch;

    class TimerExample{
    public:
        TimerExample(){ _sw.start();}

        void onTimer(Timer& timer){
            std::cout << "Callback called after " << _sw.elapsed()/1000 << " milliseconds." << std::endl;
        }
    private:
        Stopwatch _sw;
    };

    int main(int argc, char** argv){
        TimerExample example;
        Timer timer(250, 500);
        timer.start(TimerCallback<TimerExample>(example, &TimerExample::onTimer));

        Thread::sleep(5000);
        timer.stop();
        return 0;
    }

Now, also create a ``conanfile.txt`` inside the same folder with the following content:

.. code-block:: text
   :caption: **conanfile.txt**

    [requires]
    Poco/1.8.0.1@pocoproject/stable

    [generators]
    cmake

In this example we will use **CMake** to build the project, which is why the **cmake** generator 
is specified. This generator will create a ``conanbuildinfo.cmake`` file that defines CMake
variables as include paths and library names, that can be used in our build.

.. note::

    If you are not a CMake user, change the **[generators]** section of your **conanfile.txt** to
    **gcc** or a more generic one **txt** to handle requirements with any build system. Learn more
    in :ref:`Using packages<using_packages>`.

Just include the generated file and use those variables inside our own ``CMakeLists.txt``: 

.. code-block:: cmake
   :caption: **CMakeLists.txt**

    project(FoundationTimer)
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)
    add_definitions("-std=c++11")

    include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
    conan_basic_setup()

    add_executable(timer timer.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(timer ${CONAN_LIBS})

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

If you have a terminal with light colors, like the default gnome terminal in Ubuntu,
set ``CONAN_COLOR_DARK=1`` to have a better contrast. Then create a build folder, so temporary build
files are put there, and install the requirements (pointing to the parent directory, as it is where
the ``conanfile.txt`` is):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ conan install ..

This ``install`` command will download the binary package required for your configuration (detected
the first time that you ran the conan command), **together with other (transitively required by
Poco) libraries, like OpenSSL and Zlib**. It will also create the ``conanbuildinfo.cmake`` file in
the current directory, in which you can see the cmake defined variables, and a ``conaninfo.txt``
where information about settings, requirements and options is saved.

It is very important to understand the installation process. When a ``conan install`` command is
issued, it will use some settings, specified on the command line or taken from the defaults in
``<userhome>/.conan/profiles/default`` file.

.. image:: images/install_flow.png
   :height: 400 px
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

So for a command like ``$ conan install .. -s os="Linux" -s compiler="gcc"``, the steps are:

- First check if the package recipe (for ``Poco/1.8.0.1@pocoproject/stable`` package) exists in the
  local cache. If we are just starting, our cache will be empty.
- Look for the package recipe in the defined remotes. By default, conan comes with the Bintray
  remotes defined (you can change that), so the conan client will search in `conan-center` and
  `conan-transit` for the recipe.
- If the recipe exists, conan client will fetch and store it in your local cache.
- With the package recipe and the input settings (Linux, gcc), conan client will check in the local
  cache if the corresponding binary is there, if we are installing for the first time, it won't.
- Conan client will search for the corresponding binary package in the remote, if it exists, it will
  be fetched.
- Conan client will then finish generating the requested files specified in ``generators``.

If the binary package necessary for some given settings doesn't exist, conan client will throw an
error. It is possible to try to build the binary package from sources with the ``--build missing``
command line argument to install. Detailed explanations about how a binary package is built from
sources will be given in a later section.

.. warning::

    In the Bintray repositories there are binaries for several mainstream compilers and versions,
    like Visual Studio 12, 14, linux-gcc 4.9 and apple-clang 3.5. If you are using another setup,
    the command might fail because of the missing package. You could try to change your settings or
    build the package from source, using the ``--build missing`` option, instead of retrieving the
    binaries. Such a build might not have been tested and eventually fail.

Building the timer example
--------------------------

Now, you are ready to build and run your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    (win)
    $ cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64"
    $ cmake --build . --config Release

    (linux, mac)
    $ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ cmake --build .
    ...
    [100%] Built target timer
    $ ./bin/timer
    Callback called after 250 milliseconds.
    ...

Inspecting dependencies
-----------------------

The retrieved packages have been installed to your local user cache (typically ``.conan/data``), so
they can be reused from there in other projects, and allow to clean your current project and keep
working even without network connection. To search packages in the local cache you can do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search

You can also inspect the binary packages (for different installed binaries for a given package
recipe) details with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search Poco/1.8.0.1@pocoproject/stable

You can also generate a table for all binaries from a given recipe with the ``--table`` option, even
in remotes:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search zlib/1.2.11@conan/stable --table=file.html -r=conan-center
    $ file.html # or open the file, double-click

.. image:: /images/search_binary_table.png
    :height: 250 px
    :width: 300 px
    :align: center

Please check the reference for more information on how to search in remotes, or how to remove or
clean packages from the local cache, or how to define custom cache directory per user or per
project.

You can also inspect your current project's dependencies with the ``info`` command, pointing it to
the folder where the ``conanfile.txt`` is:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan info ..

You can generate a graph of your dependencies, in dot or html formats:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan info .. --graph=file.html
    $ file.html # or open the file, double-click

.. image:: /images/info_deps_html_graph.png
    :height: 150 px
    :width: 200 px
    :align: center

Building with other configurations
----------------------------------

In this example we have built our project using the default configuration detected by conan, this
configuration is known as the :ref:`default profile<default_profile>`.

The first time you run the **conan** command, your settings are detected (compiler,
architecture...) automatically and stored as default in a profile. You can change your those
settings by editing ``~/.conan/profiles/default`` or create new profiles with the desired
configuration.

.. attention::

    - It is strongly recommended to review the generated default profile and adjust the settings to
      describe accurately your system.

    - When a GCC **compiler >= 5.1** is detected, the setting modeling the c++ standard library:
      ``compiler.libcxx`` will be set to ``libstdc++`` that represent the old ABI compatibility for
      better compatibility.
      Your compiler default is likely the new ABI so you might want to change it to ``libstdc++11``
      to use the new ABI compliant with CXX11 directives. :ref:`Read more<manage_gcc_abi>`.


For example, if we have a profile with a gcc configutarion for 32 bits in a profile called
**gcc_x86**, we could issue the ``install`` command like this:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ conan install . -pr gcc_x86

.. tip::

    Using profiles is strongly recommended. Learn more about them :ref:`here<profiles>`.


However, the user can always override the default profile settings in **install** command with the
**-s** parameter. As an exercise to the reader, let's try building the timer project with a
different configuration. For example, building the 32 bits version:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ conan install . -s arch=x86

This will install a different package, using the ``-s arch=x86`` setting, instead of the default
used previously, that in most cases will be ``x86_64``.

To use the 32 bits binaries you will also have to change your project build:
  - In Windows, change the CMake invocation accordingly to ``Visual Studio 14``.
  - In Linux, you have to add the ``-m32`` flag to your ``CMakeLists.txt`` with
    ``SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -m32")``, and the same to
    ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS, CMAKE_SHARED_LINK_FLAGS and CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS``.
    This can also be done more easily, automatically with conan, as we'll see later.
  - In Mac, you need to add the definition ``-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386``.
