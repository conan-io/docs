Road to Conan 2.0
=================

Conan has started to work on the next major release. We've been gathering feedback
from the community about our features and we think it's time to break some default
behaviors, clean the codebase and add space for new developments. Development is
ongoing and the `Conan 2.0 Tribe <https://conan.io/tribe.html>`_ is having discussions
about it.

In the future, this section will contain relevant information and changes regarding Conan 2.0,
there is a lot of work ahead, as you can see in `our backlog <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/milestones>`_.

Meanwhile, in version 1.23 we have introduced an environment variable to raise errors in case of using features
that will be deprecated in Conan 2.0. Read more about ``CONAN_V2_MODE`` in :ref:`this section <conan_v2_mode>`.

Stay tuned!
