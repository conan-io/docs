Contributing Packages to Conan-center
=====================================

Contribution of packages to Conan-center is done via pull requests to the Github repository in https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index. The C3I (Conan-Center Continuous Integration) service will build binaries automatically from those pull requests, and once merged, will upload them to Bintray Conan-center.

.. warning::

    The previous process to contribute to Conan-center, known as "inclusion requests" from Bintray is deprecated. It is not longer needed to create your own packages and upload them to your Bintray personal repo. Only the Github pull request will be needed.
