VirtualRunEnv
===============

.. important::

    Some of the features used in this section are still **under development**, while they are
    recommended and usable and we will try not to break them in future releases, some breaking
    changes might still happen if necessary to prepare for the *Conan 2.0 release*.

Available since: `1.39.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.39.0>`_

The ``VirtualRunEnv`` generator can be used by name in conanfiles:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        generators = "VirtualRunEnv"

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: conanfile.txt

    [generators]
    VirtualRunEnv

And it can also be fully instantiated in the conanfile ``generate()`` method:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.env import VirtualRunEnv

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "arch", "build_type"
        requires = "zlib/1.2.11", "bzip2/1.0.8"

        def generate(self):
            ms = VirtualRunEnv(self)
            ms.generate()

When the ``VirtualRunEnv`` generator is used, calling :command:`conan install` will generate a *conanrunenv* .bat or .sh script
containing environment variables of the run time environment.

The launcher contains the runtime environment information, anything that is necessary in the environment to actually run
the compiled executables and applications. The information is obtained from the ``self.runenv_info`` and also automatically
deduced from the ``self.cpp_info`` definition of the package, to define ``PATH``, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH``
and ``DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`` environment variables.

This generator will create the following files:

- conanrunenv-release-x86_64.(bat|sh): This file contains the actual definition of environment variables
  like PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc, and ``runenv_info`` of dependencies corresponding to the ``host`` context,
  and to the current installed configuration. If a repeated call is done with other settings, a different file will be created.
- conanrun.(bat|sh): Accumulates the calls to one or more other scripts to give one single convenient file
  for all. This only calls the latest specific configuration one, that is, if ``conan install`` is called first for Release build type,
  and then for Debug, ``conanrun.(bat|sh)`` script will call the Debug one.

After the execution of one of those files, a new deactivation script will be generated, capturing the current
environment, so the environment can be restored when desired. The file will be named also following the
current active configuration, like ``deactivate_conanrunenv-release-x86_64.bat``.

Let's see an example on how to add an environment variable to the ``runenv_info`` and get its value later
in the consumer side using the ``conanrun`` launcher:


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    from conan import ConanFile

    class HelloConan(ConanFile):

        def package_info(self):
            self.runenv_info.define("MYVAR", "My value!")


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: test_package/conanfile.py

    from conan import ConanFile

    class HelloTestConan(ConanFile):
        # VirtualBuildEnv and VirtualRunEnv can be avoided if "tools.env.virtualenv:auto_use" is defined
        # (it will be defined in Conan 2.0)
        generators = "VirtualRunEnv"

        def test(self):
            self.run("echo $MYVAR", env="conanrun")  # Unix-style

As we already said above, the ``conanrun`` launcher contains the runtime environment information, so let's run
a :command:`conan create . hello/1.0@` and check the console output that should show something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    ....
    Configuring environment variables
    My value!


Constructor
+++++++++++

.. code:: python

    def __init__(self, conanfile):

- ``conanfile``: the current recipe object. Always use ``self``.


generate()
++++++++++

.. code:: python

    def generate(self, scope="run"):


Parameters:

    * **scope** (Defaulted to ``run``): Add the launcher automatically to the ``conanrun`` launcher. Read more
      in the :ref:`Environment documentation <conan_tools_env_environment_model>`.
