JFrog Academy: Conan 2 Training
================================

Conan 2 training is available on the JFrog Academy in two paths: **Conan 2
Essentials** and **Conan 2 Advanced**. There are 29 video lessons across 7
modules (16 in Essentials, 13 in Advanced). The courses are practical (with code
you can follow along), free, and self-paced.

The examples in the courses use the `Conan Training 2 GitHub repository
<https://github.com/conan-io/conan-training2>`__. If you run into problems with
the code or have feedback, open an issue there.

  Header-only libraries, prebuilt binaries, tool requires.

Conan 2 Advanced
-----------------

For users who already know Conan 2 basics. Local development, dependency graph,
extensibility, and the advanced binary model.
