Profile plugin
---------------

The ``profile.py`` extension plugin is a Python script that receives one profile and allow
checking and modifying it.

This plugin is located in the ``extensions/plugins/profile.py`` cache folder.

This ``profile.py`` contains a default implementation that does:

- Will try to define ``compiler.runtime_type`` for ``msvc`` and ``clang`` compilers (in Windows) if it is not defined, and it will define it to match the ``settings.build_type``.
  That allow users to let it undefined in profiles, and switch it conveniently in command line just with ``-s build_type=Debug``
- Will check the ``compiler.cppstd`` value if defined to validate if the current compiler version has support for it. For example, if a developer
  tries to use ``-s compiler=gcc -s compiler.version=5 -s compiler.cppstd=20``, it will raise an error.
- Even though the ``profile.py`` plugin has some provision to handle ``compiler.cstd`` checks, they are not implemented yet, so the plugin will be permissive
  regarding definition errors, please make sure the ``compiler.cstd`` is actually supported by your compiler version.



Users can customize this ``profile.py`` and distribute it via ``conan config install``, in that case, the first lines should be removed:

.. code-block:: python

    # This file was generated by Conan. Remove this comment if you edit this file or Conan
    # will destroy your changes.


And ``profile.py`` should contain one function with the signature:

.. code-block:: python

    def profile_plugin(profile):
        settings = profile.settings
        print(settings)


When a profile is computed, it will display something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    OrderedDict([('arch', 'x86_64'), ('build_type', 'Release'), ('compiler', 'msvc'), ('compiler.cppstd', '14'), ('compiler.runtime', 'dynamic'), ('compiler.runtime_type', 'Release'), ('compiler.version', '192'), ('os', 'Windows')])
