Build systems
=============

Conan can be integrated with any build system. This can be done with:


- :ref:`Generators<generators>`: Conan can write file/s in different formats gathering all the information
  from the dependency tree, like include directories, library names, library dirs...

- :ref:`Build Helpers<build_helpers>`: Conan provides some classes to help calling your build system, translating
  the `settings` and `options` to the arguments, flags or environment variables that your build system expect.
