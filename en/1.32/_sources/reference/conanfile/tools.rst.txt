.. _conan_tools:

tools
=====

Tools are all things that can be imported and used in Conan recipes.

.. warning::

    These tools are **experimental** and subject to breaking changes.

.. important::

    This is the current design for Conan 2.0, and these will be the supported tools. Only the tools documented
    in this section will be available in Conan 2.0.


The import path is always like:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMakeDeps, CMake
    form conan.tools.microsoft import MSBuildToolchain, MSBuildDeps, MSBuild


The main guidelines are:

- Everything that recipes can import belong to ``from conan.tools``. Any other thing is private implementation
  and shouldn't be used in recipes.
- Only documented, public (not preceded by ``_``) tools can be used in recipes.
