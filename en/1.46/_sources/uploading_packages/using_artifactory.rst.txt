Using Artifactory
-----------------

In Artifactory, you can create and manage as many free, personal Conan repositories as you like.
On an `Free-Tier`_ account, all packages you upload are public, and anyone can use them by simply adding your
repository to their Conan remotes. You still can create private repositories using :ref:`Artifatory CE<artifactory_ce>`
or Artifactory Cloud Premium account.
