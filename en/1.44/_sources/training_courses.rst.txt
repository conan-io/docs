Training Courses
============================================

JFrog has created the JFrog Academy to host a broad range of free online courses
surrounding Devops. The Conan team has created the "Conan series" on JFrog
Academy, which includes several levels of courses covering both beginner
concepts and advanced scenarios.  

The courses are completely free and self-paced.  They feature interactive
exercises which walk users through the running of commands, exploring and
editing of important Conan-related files and directories, and quizzes to invoke
critical thinking after each section.  

For additional information about the Conan training series, see the original
