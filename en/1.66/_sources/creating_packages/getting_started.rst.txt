Getting started
===============

This section introduces how to create your own Conan packages, explain *conanfile.py* recipes and the commands to build
packages from sources in your computer.


.. important::

    This is a **tutorial** section. You are encouraged to execute these commands.
    For this concrete example, you will need **CMake** installed  in your path.
    It is not strictly required by Conan to create packages, you can use
    other build systems (as VS, Meson, Autotools and even your own) to do that, without any dependency
    to CMake.

    Some of the features used in this section are still **under development**, like ``CMakeToolchain`` or ``cmake_layout()``,
    while they are recommended and usable and we will try not to break them in future releases, some breaking
    changes might still happen if necessary to prepare for the *Conan 2.0 release*.


Using the :command:`conan new` command will create a "Hello World" C++ library example project for us:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir hellopkg && cd hellopkg
    $ conan new hello/0.1 --template=cmake_lib
    File saved: conanfile.py
    File saved: CMakeLists.txt
    File saved: src/hello.cpp
    File saved: src/hello.h
    File saved: test_package/conanfile.py
    File saved: test_package/CMakeLists.txt
    File saved: test_package/src/example.cpp


The generated files are:

- **conanfile.py**: On the root folder, there is a *conanfile.py* which is the main recipe file, responsible for defining how the package is built and consumed.
- **CMakeLists.txt**: A simple generic *CMakeLists.txt*, with nothing specific about Conan in it.
- **src** folder: the *src* folder that contains the simple C++ "hello" library.
- (optional) **test_package** folder: contains an *example* application that will require and link with the created package.
  It is not mandatory, but it is useful to check that our package is correctly created.

Let's have a look at the package recipe *conanfile.py*:

.. code-block:: python

    from conans import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMake, cmake_layout

    class HelloConan(ConanFile):
        name = "hello"
        version = "0.1"

        # Binary configuration
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
        options = {"shared": [True, False], "fPIC": [True, False]}
        default_options = {"shared": False, "fPIC": True}

        # Sources are located in the same place as this recipe, copy them to the recipe
        exports_sources = "CMakeLists.txt", "src/*"

        def config_options(self):
            if self.settings.os == "Windows":
                del self.options.fPIC

        def layout(self):
            cmake_layout(self)

        def generate(self):
            tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
            tc.generate()

        def build(self):
            cmake = CMake(self)
            cmake.configure()
            cmake.build()

        def package(self):
            cmake = CMake(self)
            cmake.install()

        def package_info(self):
            self.cpp_info.libs = ["hello"]


Let's explain a little bit about this recipe:

- The binary configuration is composed by ``settings`` and ``options``. See more in :ref:`this section<settings_vs_options>`.
  When something changes in the configuration, the resulting binary built and packaged will be different:

  - ``settings`` are project wide configuration, that cannot be defaulted in recipes, like the OS or the
    architecture.
  - ``options`` are package specific configuration and can be defaulted in recipes, in this case we
    have the option of creating the package as a shared or static library, being static the default.

- The ``exports_sources`` attribute defines which sources are exported together with the recipe, these
  sources become part of the package recipe (there are other mechanisms that don't do this, which will be explained
  later).

- The ``config_options()`` method (together with ``configure()``) allows to fine tune the binary configuration
  model. For example, in Windows there is no ``fPIC`` option, so it can be removed.

- The ``generate()`` method prepares the build of the package from source. In this case, it could be simplified
  to an attribute ``generators = "CMakeToolchain"``, but it is left to show this important method. In this case,
  the execution of ``CMakeToolchain`` ``generate()`` method will create a *conan_toolchain.cmake* file that maps
  the Conan ``settings`` and ``options`` to CMake syntax.

- The ``build()`` method uses the ``CMake`` wrapper to call CMake commands. It is a thin layer that will manage
  to pass in this case the ``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path>/conan_toolchain.cmake`` argument, plus other possible arguments, 
  like ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<config>`` if necessary. It will configure the project and build it from source. The actual
  arguments that will be used are obtained from a generated ``CMakePresets.json`` file.

- The ``package()`` method copies artifacts (headers, libs) from the build folder to the final
  package folder. It can be done with bare "copy" commands, but in this case it is leveraging the already
  existing CMake install functionality (if the CMakeLists.txt didn't implement it, it is easy to write ``self.copy()``
  commands in this ``package()`` method.

- Finally, the ``package_info()`` method defines that consumers must link with a "hello" library
  when using this package. Other information as include or lib paths can be defined as well. This
  information is used for files created by generators (as ``CMakeDeps``) to be used by consumers. Although
  this method implies some potential duplication with the build system output (CMake could generate xxx-config.cmake files),
  it is important to define this, as Conan packages can be consumed by any other build system, not only CMake.


The contents of the ``test_package`` folder is not critical now for understanding how packages are created, the important
bits are:

- ``test_package`` folder is different from unit or integration tests. These tests are "package" tests, and validate that the package is properly
  created, and that the package consumers will be able to link against it and reuse it.
- It is a small Conan project itself, it contains its own ``conanfile.py``, and its source code including build scripts, that depends on
  the package being created, and builds and execute a small application that requires the library in the package.
- It doesn't belong to the package. It only exist in the source repository, not in the package.



Let's build the package from sources with the current default configuration (default profile), and then let the ``test_package`` folder test the package:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan create . demo/testing
    ...
    hello/0.1: Hello World Release!
      hello/0.1: _M_X64 defined
      ...

If "Hello world Release!" is displayed, it worked. This is what has happened:

- The *conanfile.py* together with the contents of the *src* folder have been copied (exported in Conan terms) to the
  local Conan cache.
- A new build from source for the ``hello/0.1@demo/testing`` package starts, calling the ``generate()``, ``build()`` and
  ``package()`` methods. This creates the binary package in the Conan cache.
- Moves to the *test_package* folder and executes a ``conan install`` + ``conan build`` + ``test()`` method, to check if
  the package was correctly created. This happens automatically whenever a ``test_package`` folder is supplied next to 
  the ``conanfile.py`` being processed.

We can now validate that the recipe and the package binary are in the cache:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search
    Existing package recipes:

    hello/0.1@demo/testing

    $ conan search hello/0.1@demo/testing
    Existing packages for recipe hello/0.1@demo/testing:

    Package_ID: 3fb49604f9c2f729b85ba3115852006824e72cab
        [options]
            shared: False
        [settings]
            arch: x86_64
            build_type: Release
            ...


The :command:`conan create` command receives the same command line parameters as :command:`conan install` so
you can pass to it the same settings and options. If we execute the following lines, we will create new package
binaries for those configurations:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan create . demo/testing -s build_type=Debug
    ...
    hello/0.1: Hello World Debug!

    $ conan create . demo/testing -o hello:shared=True
    ...
    hello/0.1: Hello World Release!


These new package binaries will be also stored in the Conan cache, ready to be used by any project in this computer,
we can see them with:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search hello/0.1@demo/testing
    Existing packages for recipe hello/0.1@demo/testing:

        Package_ID: 127af201a4cdf8111e2e08540525c245c9b3b99e
            [options]
                shared: True
            [settings]
                arch: x86_64
                build_type: Release
                ...
        Package_ID: 3fb49604f9c2f729b85ba3115852006824e72cab
            [options]
                shared: False
            [settings]
                arch: x86_64
                build_type: Release
                ...

        Package_ID: d057732059ea44a47760900cb5e4855d2bea8714
            [options]
                shared: False
            [settings]
                arch: x86_64
                build_type: Debug
                ...
