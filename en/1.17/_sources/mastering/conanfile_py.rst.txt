Use conanfile.py for consumers
===============================

You can use a ``conanfile.py`` for installing/consuming packages, even if you are not creating a package with it. You can also use the existing ``conanfile.py`` in a given package while developing it to install dependencies. There's no need to have a separate ``conanfile.txt``.

Let's take a look at the complete ``conanfile.txt`` from the previous *timer* example with POCO library, in which we have added a couple of extra generators

.. code-block:: text

      [requires]
      Poco/1.7.8p3@pocoproject/stable

      [generators]
      gcc
      cmake
      txt

      [options]
      Poco:shared=True
      OpenSSL:shared=True

      [imports]
      bin, *.dll -> ./bin # Copies all dll files from the package "bin" folder to my project "bin" folder
      lib, *.dylib* -> ./bin # Copies all dylib files from the package "lib" folder to my project "bin" folder


The equivalent ``conanfile.py`` file is:

.. code-block:: python

   from conans import ConanFile, CMake

   class PocoTimerConan(ConanFile):
      settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
      requires = "Poco/1.7.8p3@pocoproject/stable" # comma-separated list of requirements
      generators = "cmake", "gcc", "txt"
      default_options = {"Poco:shared": True, "OpenSSL:shared": True}

      def imports(self):
         self.copy("*.dll", dst="bin", src="bin") # From bin to bin
         self.copy("*.dylib*", dst="bin", src="lib") # From lib to bin


Note that this ``conanfile.py`` doesn't have a name, version, or ``build()`` or ``package()`` method, as it is not creating a package. They are not required.

With this ``conanfile.py`` you can just work as usual. Nothing changes from the user's perspective.
You can install the requirements with (from mytimer/build folder):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conan install ..


conan build
------------

One advantage of using ``conanfile.py`` is that the project build can be further simplified,
using the conanfile.py ``build()`` method.


If you are building your project with CMake, edit your ``conanfile.py`` and add the following ``build()`` method:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 13, 14, 15, 16

   from conans import ConanFile, CMake

   class PocoTimerConan(ConanFile):
      settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
      requires = "Poco/1.7.8p3@pocoproject/stable"
      generators = "cmake", "gcc", "txt"
      default_options = {"Poco:shared": True, "OpenSSL:shared": True}

      def imports(self):
         self.copy("*.dll", dst="bin", src="bin") # From bin to bin
         self.copy("*.dylib*", dst="bin", src="lib") # From lib to bin

      def build(self):
         cmake = CMake(self)
         cmake.configure()
         cmake.build()

   
Then execute, from your project root:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install . --install-folder build
    $ conan build . --build-folder build

The :command:`conan install` command downloads and prepares the requirements of your project
(for the specified settings) and the :command:`conan build` command uses all that information
to invoke your ``build()`` method to build your project, which in turn calls ``cmake``.

This :command:`conan build` will use the settings used in the :command:`conan install` which have been cached in the local *conaninfo.txt* and file
in your build folder. This simplifies the process and reduces the errors of mismatches between the installed packages and the current
project configuration. Also, the *conanbuildinfo.txt* file contains all the needed information obtained from the requirements:
``deps_cpp_info``, ``deps_env_info``, ``deps_user_info`` objects.


If you want to build your project for **x86** or another setting just change the parameters passed to :command:`conan install`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install . --install-folder build_x86 -s arch=x86
    $ conan build . --build-folder build_x86

Implementing and using the conanfile.py ``build()`` method ensures that we always use the same
settings both in the installation of requirements and the build of the project, and simplifies
calling the build system.

Other local commands
----------------------

Conan implements other commands that can be executed locally over a consumer ``conanfile.py`` which is in user space, not in the local cache:

- :command:`conan source <path>`: Execute locally the *conanfile.py* ``source()`` method.
- :command:`conan package <path>`: Execute locally the *conanfile.py* ``package()`` method.

These commands are mostly used for testing and debugging while developing a new package, before **exporting** such package recipe into the
local cache.
