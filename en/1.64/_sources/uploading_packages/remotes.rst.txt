Remotes
=======

In the previous sections, we built several packages on our computer that were stored
in the local cache, typically under *~/.conan/data*. Now, you might want to upload them to a Conan server
for later use on another machine, project, or for sharing purposes.

Conan packages can be uploaded to different remotes previously configured with a name and a URL.
The remotes are just servers used as binary repositories that store packages by reference.

There are several possibilities when uploading packages to a server:

- **Artifactory Community Edition for C/C++**: Artifactory Community Edition (CE) for C/C++ is a
  completely free Artifactory server that implements both Conan and generic repositories. It is
  the recommended server for companies and teams wanting to host their own private repository.
  It has a web UI, advanced authentication and permissions, very good performance and scalability,
  a REST API, and can host generic artifacts (tarballs, zips, etc). Check :ref:`artifactory_ce`
  for more information.
- **Artifactory Pro**: Artifactory is the binary repository manager for all major packaging formats. It
  is the recommended remote type for enterprise and professional package management. Check the
  `Artifactory documentation`_ for more information. For a comparison between Artifactory editions,
  check the `Artifactory Comparison Matrix <https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+Comparison+Matrix>`_.
- **Conan server**: Simple, free and open source, MIT licensed server that comes bundled with the Conan client.
  Check :ref:`running_your_server` for more information.

conancenter
-----------

**ConanCenter** (https://conan.io/center) is the main official repository for open source
Conan packages. It is configured as the default remote in the Conan client, but if you want to add it manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan remote add conancenter https://center.conan.io

It contains **packages without "user/channel"** that can be used directly as `pkg/version` (`zlib/1.2.11`): These packages are created
automatically from the central GitHub repository `conan-center-index <https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index>`_, with an automated
build service: C3I (ConanCenter Continuous Integration).

To contribute packages to ConanCenter, read the :ref:`ConanCenter guide <conan_center_flow>` for more information.
