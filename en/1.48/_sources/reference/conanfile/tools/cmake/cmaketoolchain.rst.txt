CMakeToolchain
--------------

.. warning::

    These tools are still **experimental** (so subject to breaking changes) but with very stable syntax.
    We encourage the usage of it to be prepared for Conan 2.0.


The ``CMakeToolchain`` is the toolchain generator for CMake. It will generate toolchain files that can be used in the
command line invocation of CMake with the ``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake``. This generator translates
the current package configuration, settings, and options, into CMake toolchain syntax.


.. important::

    This class will require very soon to define both the "host" and "build" profiles. It is very recommended to
    start defining both profiles immediately to avoid future breaking. Furthermore, some features, like trying to
    cross-compile might not work at all if the "build" profile is not provided.

It can be declared as:

.. code-block:: python

    from conans import ConanFile

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        generators = "CMakeToolchain"

Or fully instantiated in the ``generate()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from conans import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        requires = "hello/0.1"
        generators = "CMakeDeps"
        options = {"shared": [True, False], "fPIC": [True, False]}
        default_options = {"shared": False, "fPIC": True}

        def generate(self):
            tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
            tc.variables["MYVAR"] = "MYVAR_VALUE"
            tc.preprocessor_definitions["MYDEFINE"] = "MYDEF_VALUE"
            tc.generate()


This will generate the following files after a ``conan install`` (or when building the package
in the cache) with the information provided in the ``generate()`` method as well as information
translated from the current ``settings``:

- *conan_toolchain.cmake* file, containing the translation of Conan settings to CMake variables.
  Some things that will be defined in this file:

  - Definition of the CMake generator platform and generator toolset
  - Definition of the ``CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``, based on ``fPIC`` option.
  - Definition of the C++ standard as necessary
  - Definition of the standard library used for C++
  - Deactivation of rpaths in OSX

- *CMakePresets.json*: The toolchain also generates a ``CMakePresets.json`` standard file, check the documentation
  `here <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html>`_. It is currently using the version "3" of
  the JSON schema.
  Conan creates a ``default`` configure preset with the information:

     - The ``generator`` to be used.
     - The path to the ``conan_toolchain.cmake``
     - Some cache variables corresponding to the specified settings cannot work if specified in the toolchain.
     - The ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` variable when using a single-configuration generators.

- *CMakeUserPresets.json*:  If you declare a ``layout()`` in the recipe and your ``CMakeLists.txt`` file is found at
  the ``conanfile.source_folder`` folder, a ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` file will be generated (if doesn't exist already) including
  automatically the ``CMakePresets.json`` (at the ``conanfile.generators_folder``) to allow your IDE (Visual Studio,
  Visual Studio Code, CLion...) or ``cmake`` tool to locate the ``CMakePresets.json``. The version schema of the generated
  ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` is "4" and requires CMake >= 3.23.


- *conanvcvars.bat*: In some cases, the Visual Studio environment needs to be defined correctly for building,
  like when using the Ninja or NMake generators. If necessary, the ``CMakeToolchain`` will generate this script,
  so defining the correct Visual Studio prompt is easier.


constructor
+++++++++++

.. code:: python

    def __init__(self, conanfile):

- ``conanfile``: the current recipe object. Always use ``self``.


preprocessor_definitions
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This attribute allows defining compiler preprocessor definitions, for multiple configurations (Debug, Release, etc).

.. code:: python

    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        tc.preprocessor_definitions["MYDEF"] = "MyValue"
        tc.preprocessor_definitions.debug["MYCONFIGDEF"] = "MyDebugValue"
        tc.preprocessor_definitions.release["MYCONFIGDEF"] = "MyReleaseValue"
        tc.generate()

This will be translated to:

- One ``add_definitions()`` definition for ``MYDEF`` in ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` file.
- One ``add_definitions()`` definition, using a cmake generator expression in ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` file,
  using the different values for different configurations.

variables
+++++++++

This attribute allows defining CMake variables, for multiple configurations (Debug, Release, etc).

.. code:: python

    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        tc.variables["MYVAR"] = "MyValue"
        tc.variables.debug["MYCONFIGVAR"] = "MyDebugValue"
        tc.variables.release["MYCONFIGVAR"] = "MyReleaseValue"
        tc.generate()

This will be translated to:

- One ``set()`` definition for ``MYVAR`` in ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` file.
- One ``set()`` definition, using a cmake generator expression in ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` file,
  using the different values for different configurations.

The booleans assigned to a variable will be translated to ``ON`` and ``OFF`` symbols in CMake:

.. code:: python

    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        tc.variables["FOO"] = True
        tc.variables["VAR"] = False
        tc.generate()


Will generate the sentences: ``set(FOO ON ...)`` and ``set(VAR OFF ...)``.



Generators
++++++++++

The ``CMakeToolchain`` is intended to run with the ``CMakeDeps`` dependencies generator. Please do not use other
CMake legacy generators (like ``cmake``, or ``cmake_paths``) with it.


Using a custom toolchain file
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two ways of providing custom CMake toolchain files:

- The ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` file can be completely skipped and replaced by a user one, defining the
  ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:toolchain_file=<filepath>`` configuration value.
- A custom user toolchain file can be added (included from) to the ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` one, by using the
  ``user_toolchain`` block described below, and defining the ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:user_toolchain=["<filepath>"]``
  configuration value.

  The configuration ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:user_toolchain=["<filepath>"]`` can be defined in the :ref:`global.conf<global_conf>`
  but also creating a Conan package for your toolchain and using ``self.conf_info`` to declare the toolchain file:

    .. code:: python

        import os
        from conans import ConanFile
        class MyToolchainPackage(ConanFile):
            ...
            def package_info(self):
                f = os.path.join(self.package_folder, "mytoolchain.cmake")
                self.conf_info.define("tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:user_toolchain", [f])


  If you declare the previous package as a ``tool_require``, the toolchain will be automatically applied.
- If you have more than one ``tool_requires`` defined, you can easily append all the user toolchain values
  together using the ``append`` method in each of them, for instance:

    .. code:: python

        import os
        from conans import ConanFile
        class MyToolRequire(ConanFile):
            ...
            def package_info(self):
                f = os.path.join(self.package_folder, "mytoolchain.cmake")
                # Appending the value to any existing one
                self.conf_info.append("tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:user_toolchain", f)


  So, they'll be automatically applied by your ``CMakeToolchain`` generator without writing any extra code:

    .. code:: python

        from conans import ConanFile
        from conan.tools.cmake import CMake
        class Pkg(ConanFile):
            settings = "os", "compiler", "arch", "build_type"
            exports_sources = "CMakeLists.txt"
            tool_requires = "toolchain1/0.1", "toolchain2/0.1"
            generators = "CMakeToolchain"

            def build(self):
                cmake = CMake(self)
                cmake.configure()


Using the toolchain in developer flow
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

One of the advantages of using Conan toolchains is that they can help to achieve the exact same build
with local development flows, than when the package is created in the cache.


.. code:: bash

    # Lets start in the folder containing the conanfile.py
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    # Install both debug and release deps and create the toolchain
    $ conan install ..
    $ conan install .. -s build_type=Debug
    # the conan_toolchain.cmake is common for both configurations

If you are using a multi-configuration generator:

.. code:: bash

    # Need to pass the generator WITHOUT the platform, that matches your default settings
    $ cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake
    # Now you can open the IDE, select Debug or Release config and build
    # or, in the command line
    $ cmake --build . --config Release
    $ cmake --build . --config Debug


**NOTE**: The platform (Win64), is already encoded in the toolchain. The command line shouldn't pass it, so using
``-G "Visual Studio 15"`` instead of the ``-G "Visual Studio 15 Win64"``


If you are using a single-configuration generator:

.. code:: bash

    $ cmake ..  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ cmake --build


It is recommended to use the ``cmake_layout(self)`` in the ``layout()`` method of your ``conanfile.py``. If a layout
is declared, the ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` file will be generated in the same folder of your ``CMakeLists.txt`` file,
so you can use the ``--preset`` argument from ``cmake >= 3.23`` or use an IDE:


.. code:: bash

    # The conan_toolchain.cmake is common for both configurations and will be located at "build/generators"
    $ conan install .
    $ conan install . -s build_type=Debug

    # For single-configuration generator
    $ cmake --preset Debug
    $ cmake --build --preset Debug
    $ cmake --preset Release
    $ cmake --build --preset Release

    # For multi-configuration generator
    $ cmake --preset default
    $ cmake --build --preset Debug
    $ cmake --build --preset Release


conf
+++++

``CMakeToolchain`` is affected by these :ref:`[conf]<global_conf>` variables:

- ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:toolchain_file`` user toolchain file to replace the ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` one.
- ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:user_toolchain`` list of user toolchains to be included from the ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` file.
- ``tools.android:ndk_path`` value for ``ANDROID_NDK_PATH``.
- ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:system_name`` is not necessary in most cases and is only used to force-define ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``.
- ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:system_version`` is not necessary in most cases and is only used to force-define ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION``.
- ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:system_processor`` is not necessary in most cases and is only used to force-define ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR``.
- ``tools.build:cxxflags`` list of extra C++ flags that will be appended to ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT``.
- ``tools.build:cflags`` list of extra of pure C flags that will be appended to ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT``.
- ``tools.build:sharedlinkflags`` list of extra linker flags that will be appended to ``CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``.
- ``tools.build:exelinkflags`` list of extra linker flags that will be appended to ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``.
- ``tools.build:defines`` list of preprocessor definitions that will be used by ``add_definitions()``.
- ``tools.build:tools.apple:enable_bitcode`` boolean value to enable/disable Bitcode Apple Clang flags, e.g., ``CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_ENABLE_BITCODE``.
- ``tools.build:tools.apple:enable_arc`` boolean value to enable/disable ARC Apple Clang flags, e.g., ``CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC``.
- ``tools.build:tools.apple:enable_visibility`` boolean value to enable/disable Visibility Apple Clang flags, e.g., ``CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN``.


Extending and customizing CMakeToolchain
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since Conan 1.36, ``CMakeToolchain`` implements a powerful capability for extending and customizing the resulting toolchain file.

The following predefined blocks are available, and added in this order:

- ``user_toolchain``: Allows to include user toolchains from the ``conan_toolchain.cmake`` file.
  If the configuration ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:user_toolchain=["xxxx", "yyyy"]`` is defined, its values will be ``include(xxx)\ninclude(yyyy)`` as the
  first lines in ``conan_toolchain.cmake``.
- ``generic_system``: Defines ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``, ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION``, ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR``,
  ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``, ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET``, ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER``,
  ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER``
- ``android_system``: Defines ``ANDROID_PLATFORM``, ``ANDROID_STL``, ``ANDROID_ABI`` and includes ``ANDROID_NDK_PATH/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake``
  where ``ANDROID_NDK_PATH`` comes defined in ``tools.android:ndk_path`` configuration value.
- ``apple_system``: Defines ``CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES``, ``CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`` for Apple systems.
- ``fpic``: Defines the ``CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` when there is a ``options.fPIC``
- ``arch_flags``: Defines C/C++ flags like ``-m32, -m64`` when necessary.
- ``libcxx``: Defines ``-stdlib=libc++`` flag when necessary as well as ``_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI``.
- ``vs_runtime``: Defines the ``CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`` variable, as a generator expression for multiple configurations.
- ``cppstd``: defines ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD``, ``CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS``
- ``parallel``: defines ``/MP`` parallel build flag for Visual.
- ``cmake_flags_init``: defines ``CMAKE_XXX_FLAGS`` variables based on previously defined Conan variables. The blocks above only define ``CONAN_XXX`` variables, and this block will define CMake ones like ``set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT "${CONAN_CXX_FLAGS}" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)```.
- ``try_compile``: Stop processing the toolchain, skipping the blocks below this one, if ``IN_TRY_COMPILE`` CMake property is defined.
- ``find_paths``: Defines ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG``, ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``, ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` so the generated files from ``CMakeDeps`` are found.
- ``rpath``: Defines ``CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH``. By default it is disabled, and it is needed to define ``self.blocks["rpath"].skip_rpath=True`` if you want to activate ``CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH``
- ``shared``: defines ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``.
- ``output_dirs``: Define the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_XXX`` variables.

    - **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX**: Is set with the ``package_folder``, so if a "cmake install" operation is run, the artifacts go
      to that location.
    - **CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR**, **CMAKE_INSTALL_SBINDIR** and **CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR**: Set by default to ``bin``.
    - **CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR**: Set by default to ``lib``.
    - **CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR** and **CMAKE_INSTALL_OLDINCLUDEDIR**: Set by default to ``include``.
    - **CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR**: Set by default to ``res``.

    If you want to change the default values, adjust the ``cpp.package`` object at the ``layout()`` method:

        .. code:: python

            def layout(self):
                ...
                # For CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR, CMAKE_INSTALL_SBINDIR and CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR, takes the first value:
                self.cpp.package.bindirs = ["mybin"]
                # For CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR, takes the first value:
                self.cpp.package.libdirs = ["mylib"]
                # For CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR, CMAKE_INSTALL_OLDINCLUDEDIR, takes the first value:
                self.cpp.package.includedirs = ["myinclude"]
                # For CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR, takes the first value:
                self.cpp.package.resdirs = ["myres"]

    .. note::
        It is **not valid** to change the self.cpp_info  at the ``package_info()`` method.


.. note::
    In Conan 1.45 the CMakeToolchain doesn't append the root package folder of the dependencies (declared in the cpp_info.builddirs)
    to the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` variable. That interfered with the ``find_file``, ``find_path`` and ``find_program``, making,
    for example, impossible to locate only the executables from the build context. In Conan 2.0, the ``cppinfo.builddirs``
    won't contain by default the ``''`` entry (root package).


Blocks can be customized in different ways:

.. code:: python

    # remove an existing block
    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        tc.blocks.remove("generic_system")

    # modify the template of an existing block
    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        tmp = tc.blocks["generic_system"].template
        new_tmp = tmp.replace(...)  # replace, fully replace, append...
        tc.blocks["generic_system"].template = new_tmp

    # modify one or more variables of the context
    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(conanfile)
        # block.values is the context dictionary
        toolset = tc.blocks["generic_system"].values["toolset"]
        tc.blocks["generic_system"].values["toolset"] = "other_toolset"

    # modify the whole context values
    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(conanfile)
        tc.blocks["generic_system"].values = {"toolset": "other_toolset"}

    # modify the context method of an existing block
    import types

    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        generic_block = toolchain.blocks["generic_system"]

        def context(self):
            assert self  # Your own custom logic here
            return {"toolset": "other_toolset"}
        generic_block.context = types.MethodType(context, generic_block)

    # completely replace existing block
    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain

    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        # this could go to a python_requires
        class MyGenericBlock:
            template = "HelloWorld"

            def context(self):
                return {}

        tc.blocks["generic_system"] = MyGenericBlock

    # add a completely new block
    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain
    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        # this could go to a python_requires
        class MyBlock:
            template = "Hello {{myvar}}!!!"

            def context(self):
                return {"myvar": "World"}

        tc.blocks["mynewblock"] = MyBlock


Recall that this is a very **experimental** feature, and these interfaces might change in the following releases.

For more information about these blocks, please have a look at the source code.


Cross building
++++++++++++++

The ``generic_system`` block contains some basic cross-building capabilities. In the general
case, the user would want to provide their own user toolchain defining all the specifics,
which can be done with the configuration ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:user_toolchain``. If
this conf value is defined, the ``generic_system`` block will include the provided file or files, but
no further define any CMake variable for cross-building.

If ``user_toolchain`` is not defined and Conan detects it is cross-building, because the build
and host profiles contain different OS or architecture, it will try to define the following
variables:

- ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``: ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:system_name`` configuration if
  defined, otherwise, it will try to autodetect it. This block will consider
  cross-building if Android systems (that is managed by other blocks), and not 64bits to
  32bits builds in x86_64, sparc and ppc systems.
- ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION``: ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:system_version`` conf if defined, otherwise
  ``os.version`` subsetting (host) when defined
- ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR``: ``tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:system_processor`` conf if defined, otherwise
  ``arch`` setting (host) if defined
