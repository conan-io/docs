.. _conan_tools_microsoft:


conan.tools.microsoft
=====================

These tools allow a native integration for Microsoft Visual Studio, natively (without using CMake,
but using directly Visual Studio solutions, projects and property files).

.. important::

    Some of the features used in this section are still **under development**, while they are
    recommended and usable and we will try not to break them in future releases, some breaking
    changes might still happen if necessary to prepare for the *Conan 2.0 release*.

.. _conan_tools_microsoft_msbuilddeps:

MSBuildDeps
-----------

Available since: `1.32.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.32.0>`_

The ``MSBuildDeps`` is the dependency information generator for Microsoft MSBuild build system.
It will generate multiple *xxxx.props* properties files one per dependency of a package,
to be used by consumers using MSBuild or Visual Studio, just adding the generated properties files
to the solution and projects.

.. important::

    This class will require very soon to define both the "host" and "build" profiles. It is very recommended to
    start defining both profiles immediately to avoid future breaking. Furthermore, some features, like trying to
    cross-compile might not work at all if the "build" profile is not provided.


It is important to highlight that this one is a **dependencies generator** and it is focused
on the **dependencies** of a conanfile, not the current build.

The ``MSBuildDeps`` generator can be used by name in conanfiles:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        generators = "MSBuildDeps"

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: conanfile.txt

    [generators]
    MSBuildDeps

And it can also be fully instantiated in the conanfile ``generate()`` method:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import MSBuildDeps

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "arch", "build_type"
        requires = "zlib/1.2.11", "bzip2/1.0.8"

        def generate(self):
            ms = MSBuildDeps(self)
            ms.generate()

When the ``MSBuildDeps`` generator is used, every invocation of ``conan install`` will
generate properties files, one per dependency and per configuration. For the last *conanfile.py*
above:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install conanfile.py # default is Release
    $ conan install conanfile.py -s build_type=Debug

This is a multi-configuration generator, and will generate different files for the different Debug/Release
configuration. The above commands the following files will be generated:

- *conan_zlib_vars_release_x64.props*: ``Conanzlibxxxx`` variables definitions for the ``zlib`` dependency, Release config, like ``ConanzlibIncludeDirs``, ``ConanzlibLibs``, etc.
- *conan_zlib_vars_debug_x64.props*: Same ``Conanzlib``variables for ``zlib`` dependency, Debug config
- *conan_zlib_release_x64.props*: Activation of ``Conanzlibxxxx`` variables in the current build as standard C/C++ build configuration, Release config. This file contains also the transitive dependencies definitions.
- *conan_zlib_debug_x64.props*: Same activation of ``Conanzlibxxxx`` variables, Debug config, also inclusion of transitive dependencies.
- *conan_zlib.props*: Properties file for ``zlib``. It conditionally includes, depending on the configuration,
  one of the two immediately above Release/Debug properties files.
- Same 5 files will be generated for every dependency in the graph, in this case ``conan_bzip.props`` too, which
  will conditionally include the Release/Debug bzip properties files.
- *conandeps.props*: Properties files including all direct dependencies, in this case, it includes ``conan_zlib.props``
  and ``conan_bzip2.props``

The above files are generated when the package doesn't have components. If the package has defined components, the following files
will be generated:

- *conan_pkgname_compname_vars_release_x64.props*: Definition of variables for the component ``compname`` of the package ``pkgname``
- *conan_pkgname_compname_release_x64.props*: Activation of the above variables into VS effective variables to be used in the build
- *conan_pkgname_compname.props*: Properties file for component ``compname`` of package ``pkgname``. It conditionally includes, depending on the configuration,
  the specific activation property files.
- *conan_pkgname.props*: Properties file for package ``pkgname``. It includes and aggregates all the components of the package.
- *conandeps.props*: Same as above, aggregates all the direct dependencies property files for the packages (like ``conan_pkgname.props``)


You will be adding the *conandeps.props* to your solution project files if you want to depend on all the declared
dependencies. For single project solutions, this is probably the way to go. For multi-project solutions, you might
be more efficient and add properties files per project. You could add *conan_zlib.props* properties to "project1"
in the solution and *conan_bzip2.props* to "project2" in the solution for example. If the package has components, you
can also add to your solution the specific components you depend on, and not all of them.

Custom configurations
+++++++++++++++++++++

If your Visual Studio project defines custom configurations, like ``ReleaseShared``, or ``MyCustomConfig``,
it is possible to define it into the ``MSBuildDeps`` generator, so different project configurations can
use different set of dependencies. Let's say that our current project can be built as a shared library,
with the custom configuration ``ReleaseShared``, and the package also controls this with the ``shared``
option:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import MSBuildDeps

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "arch", "build_type"
        options = {"shared": [True, False]}
        default_options = {"shared": False}
        requires = "zlib/1.2.11"

        def generate(self):
            ms = MSBuildDeps(self)
            # We assume that -o *:shared=True is used to install all shared deps too
            if self.options.shared:
                ms.configuration = str(self.settings.build_type) + "Shared"
            ms.generate()

This will manage to generate new properties files for this custom configuration, and switching it
in the IDE allows to be switching dependencies configuration like Debug/Release, it could be also
switching dependencies from static to shared libraries.

Included dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++

``MSBuildDeps`` uses the new ``self.dependencies`` access to dependencies. The following
dependencies will be translated to properties files:

- All direct dependencies, that is, the ones declared by the current ``conanfile``, that lives in the
  host context: all regular ``requires``, plus the ``tool_requires`` that are in the host context,
  for example test frameworks as ``gtest`` or ``catch``.
- All transitive ``requires`` of those direct dependencies (all in the host context)
- Tool requires, in the build context, that is, application and executables that run in the build
  machine irrespective of the destination platform, are added exclusively to the ``<ExecutablePath>``
  property, taking the value from ``$(Conan{{name}}BinaryDirectories)`` defined properties. This
  allows to define custom build commands, invoke code generation tools, with the ``<CustomBuild>`` and
  ``<Command>`` elements.


.. _conan_tools_microsoft_msbuildtoolchain:

MSBuildToolchain
----------------

Available since: `1.32.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.32.0>`_

The ``MSBuildToolchain`` is the toolchain generator for MSBuild. It will generate MSBuild properties files
that can be added to the Visual Studio solution projects. This generator translates
the current package configuration, settings, and options, into MSBuild properties files syntax.

.. important::

    This class will require very soon to define both the "host" and "build" profiles. It is very recommended to
    start defining both profiles immediately to avoid future breaking. Furthermore, some features, like trying to
    cross-compile might not work at all if the "build" profile is not provided.


The ``MSBuildToolchain`` generator can be used by name in conanfiles:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        generators = "MSBuildToolchain"

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: conanfile.txt

    [generators]
    MSBuildToolchain

And it can also be fully instantiated in the conanfile ``generate()`` method:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import MSBuildToolchain

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def generate(self):
            tc = MSBuildToolchain(self)
            tc.generate()


The ``MSBuildToolchain`` will generate three files after a ``conan install`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan install conanfile.py # default is Release
    $ conan install conanfile.py -s build_type=Debug


- The main *conantoolchain.props* file, to be added to the project.
- A *conantoolchain_<config>.props* file, that will be conditionally included from the previous
  *conantoolchain.props* file based on the configuration and platform, e.g.:
  *conantoolchain_release_x86.props*
- A *conanvcvars.bat* file with the necessary ``vcvars`` invocation to define the build environment if necessary
  to build from the command line or from automated tools (might not be necessary if opening the IDE). This file
  will be automatically called by the ``tools.microsoft.MSBuild`` helper ``build()`` method. This file generation
  can be avoided by defining an empty string ``conf`` item ``tools.microsoft.msbuild:installation_path=""``.


Every invocation to ``conan install`` with different configuration will create a new properties ``.props``
file, that will also be conditionally included. This allows to install different configurations,
then switch among them directly from the Visual Studio IDE.

The MSBuildToolchain files can configure:

- The Visual Studio runtime (MT/MD/MTd/MDd), obtained from Conan input settings
- The C++ standard, obtained from Conan input settings

One of the advantages of using toolchains is that they can help to achieve the exact same build
with local development flows, than when the package is created in the cache.

Attributes
++++++++++

* **properties** (available since `Conan 1.53
  <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.53.0>`_): Additional properties added
  to the generated ``.props`` files. You can define the properties in a key-value syntax
  like:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import MSBuildToolchain

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def generate(self):
            msbuild = MSBuildToolchain(self)
            msbuild.properties["IncludeExternals"] = "true"
            msbuild.generate()

Then, the generated *conantoolchain_<config>.props* file will contain the defined property
in its contents:


.. code-block:: xml
    :emphasize-lines: 8

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    <ItemDefinitionGroup>
    ...
    </ItemDefinitionGroup>
    <PropertyGroup Label="Configuration">
        ...
        <IncludeExternals>true</IncludeExternals>
        ...
    </PropertyGroup>
    </Project>

conf
++++

``MSBuildToolchain`` is affected by these :ref:`[conf]<global_conf>` variables:

- ``tools.microsoft.msbuildtoolchain:compile_options`` dict-like object of extra compile options to be added to ``<ClCompile>`` section.
  The dict will be translated as follows: ``<[KEY]>[VALUE]</[KEY]>``.
- ``tools.build:cxxflags`` list of extra C++ flags that will be appended to ``<AdditionalOptions>`` section from ``<ClCompile>`` and ``<ResourceCompile>`` one.
- ``tools.build:cflags`` list of extra of pure C flags that will be appended to ``<AdditionalOptions>`` section from ``<ClCompile>`` and ``<ResourceCompile>`` one.
- ``tools.build:sharedlinkflags`` list of extra linker flags that will be appended to ``<AdditionalOptions>`` section from ``<Link>`` one.
- ``tools.build:exelinkflags`` list of extra linker flags that will be appended to ``<AdditionalOptions>`` section from ``<Link>`` one.
- ``tools.build:defines`` list of preprocessor definitions that will be appended to ``<PreprocessorDefinitions>`` section from ``<ResourceCompile>`` one.


MSBuild
-------

Available since: `1.32.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.32.0>`_

The ``MSBuild`` build helper is a wrapper around the command line invocation of MSBuild. It will abstract the
calls like ``msbuild "MyProject.sln" /p:Configuration=<conf> /p:Platform=<platform>`` into Python method calls.

The ``MSBuild`` helper can be used like:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import MSBuild

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def build(self):
            msbuild = MSBuild(self)
            msbuild.build("MyProject.sln", targets=["mytarget"])

The ``MSBuild.build()`` method internally implements a call to ``msbuild`` like:

.. code:: bash

    $ <vcvars-cmd> && msbuild "MyProject.sln" /p:Configuration=<configuration> /p:Platform=<platform> /target=mytarget

Where:

- ``vcvars-cmd`` is calling the Visual Studio prompt that matches the current recipe ``settings``
- ``configuration``, typically Release, Debug, which will be obtained from ``settings.build_type``
  but this will be configurable with ``msbuild.build_type``.
- ``platform`` is the architecture, a mapping from the ``settings.arch`` to the common 'x86', 'x64', 'ARM', 'ARM64'.
  This is configurable with ``msbuild.platform``.
- ``targets`` (since `1.52.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.52.0>`_) is an optional argument,
  defaults to ``None``, and otherwise it is a list of targets to build


attributes
++++++++++

You can customize the following attributes in case you need to change them:

- **build_type** (default ``settings.build_type``): Value for the ``/p:Configuration``.
- **platform** (default based on ``settings.arch`` to select one of these values: (``'x86', 'x64', 'ARM', 'ARM64'``):
  Value for the ``/p:Platform``.

Example:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import MSBuild

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def build(self):
            msbuild = MSBuild(self)
            msbuild.build_type = "MyRelease"
            msbuild.platform = "MyPlatform"
            msbuild.build("MyProject.sln")


conf
++++

``MSBuild`` is affected by these :ref:`[conf]<global_conf>` variables:

- ``tools.microsoft.msbuild:verbosity`` will accept one of ``"Quiet", "Minimal", "Normal", "Detailed", "Diagnostic"`` to be passed
  to the ``MSBuild.build()`` call as ``msbuild .... /verbosity:XXX``



VCVars
------

Available since: `1.39.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.39.0>`_

Generates a file called ``conanvcvars.bat`` that activate the Visual Studio developer command prompt according
to the current settings by wrapping the `vcvarsall <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2017>`_
Microsoft bash script.


The ``VCVars`` generator can be used by name in conanfiles:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        generators = "VCVars"

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: conanfile.txt

    [generators]
    VCVars

And it can also be fully instantiated in the conanfile ``generate()`` method:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import VCVars

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "arch", "build_type"
        requires = "zlib/1.2.11", "bzip2/1.0.8"

        def generate(self):
            ms = VCVars(self)
            ms.generate()

Constructor
+++++++++++

.. code:: python

    def __init__(self, conanfile):

- ``conanfile``: the current recipe object. Always use ``self``.


generate()
++++++++++

.. code:: python

    def generate(self, scope="build"):

Parameters:

    * **scope** (Defaulted to ``"build"``): Add the launcher automatically to the ``conanbuild`` launcher. Read more
      in the :ref:`Environment documentation <conan_tools_env_environment_model>`.


conf
++++

- ``tools.microsoft.msbuild:installation_path`` allows defining a path to the VS installation. In most cases it is not
  necessary, because it can be automatically obtained calling ``vswhere``, but in case it is necessary to customize it,
  define it to the full path. If it takes an empty string value, it will disable the generation of the ``conanvcvars.bat``
  completely, and the environment will not be automatically set by Conan.


conan.tools.microsoft.is_msvc()
-------------------------------

Available since: `1.45.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.45.0>`_

If the current compiler is ``Visual Studio``, ``msvc``, ``clang `` or ``intel-cc``, then
detects the runtime type and returns between ``MD``, ``MT``, ``MDd`` or ``MTd``,
otherwise, returns ``""`` (empty string). When the runtime type is ``static``, it returns
``MT``, otherwise, ``MD``. The suffix ``d`` is added when running on Debug mode.

Parameters:

Available since: `1.47.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.47.0>`_

.. code-block:: python

    def unix_path(conanfile, path):

Transforms the specified path into the correct one according to the subsystem.
To determine the subsystem:

   - The ``settings_build.os`` is checked to verify that we are running on "Windows" otherwise, the path is returned
     without changes.

   - If ``settings_build.os.subsystem`` is specified (meaning we are running Conan under that subsystem) it will be
     returned.

   - If ``conanfile.win_bash==True`` (meaning we have to run the commands inside the subsystem), the conf
     ``tools.microsoft.bash:subsystem`` has to be declared or it will raise an Exception.

   - Otherwise the path is returned without changes.

Parameters:

- **conanfile**: ConanFile instance.

.. code-block:: python

    from conan.tools.microsoft import unix_path



    def build(self):
        adjusted_path = unix_path(self, "C:\\path\\to\\stuff")


In the example above, ``adjusted_path`` will be:
    - ``/c/path/to/stuff`` if msys2 or msys
    - ``/cygdrive/c/path/to/stuff`` if cygwin

to be retained for downstream consumers that are still using Conan 1.x integrations.
All other uses are discouraged. In Conan 2, this function returns the provided path
without performing any transformations.

Parameters:

- **conanfile**: ConanFile instance.
- **path**: Filesystem path in Windows format to transform.

check_min_vs()
--------------

Available since: `1.49.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.49.0>`_

Helper method to allow the migration to 2.0 more easily. It will handle internally both ``Visual Studio``
and ``msvc`` compiler settings, by default raising a ``ConanInvalidConfiguration`` error if the minimum version
is not satisfied, or returning a boolean result with the check result if called with ``throw=False``


.. code-block:: python

    def check_min_vs(conanfile, version, raise_invalid=True):


- ``conanfile``: Always use ``self``, the current recipe
- ``version``: Minimum version that will be accepted. Use a version number following the MSVC compiler version (or ``msvc`` setting),
  that is, ``191``, ``192``, etc (updates like ``193.1`` are also acceptable)
- ``raise_invalid``: Whether to raise or return False if the version check fails. Defaults to ```True``


Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def validate(self):
        check_min_vs(self, "192")


.. _conan_tools_microsoft_msvs_toolset:

msvs_toolset()
--------------

Available since: `1.59.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.59.0>`_

.. code-block:: python

    def msvs_toolset(conanfile)

Returns the corresponding Visual Studio or msvs platform toolset based on the settings of the given ``conanfile``. For instance, it may return ``v143``
for ``compiler=Visual Studio`` with ``compiler.version=17``. If ``compiler.toolset`` was set in settings, it has a priority and always returned.
In case of invalid compiler or invalid version, ``msvs_toolset`` returns ``None``.

Parameters:
    - ``conanfile``: Always use ``self``, the current recipe

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan.tools.microsoft import msvs_toolset
    from conan.tools.scm import Version
    from conan.errors import ConanInvalidConfiguration

    def validate(self):
        toolset = msvs_toolset(self)
        if Version(toolset) < "v110":
            raise ConanInvalidConfiguration(f"{self.ref} requires Microsoft compiler toolset v110 at least.")


NMakeDeps
---------

Available since: `1.55.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.55.0>`_

This generator can be used as:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan import ConanFile

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"

        requires = "mydep/1.0"
        # attribute declaration
        generators = "NMakeDeps"

        # OR explicit usage in the generate() method
        def generate(self):
            deps = NMakeDeps(self)
            deps.generate()

        def build(self):
            self.run(f"nmake /f makefile")

The generator will create a ``conannmakedeps.bat`` environment script that defines
``CL``, ``LIB`` and ``_LINK_`` environment variables, injecting necessary flags
to locate and link the dependencies declared in ``requires``.
This generator should most likely be used together with ``NMakeToolchain`` one.

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
        generators = "NMakeToolchain"

        def build(self):
            self.run("nmake /f makefile")

Or it can be fully instantiated in the conanfile ``generate()`` method:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import NMakeToolchain

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def generate(self):
            tc = NMakeToolchain(self)
            tc.generate()

        def build(self):
            self.run("nmake /f makefile")

NMakeToolchain generator will create a ``conannmaketoolchain.bat`` environment script injecting flags
deduced from profile (build_type, runtime, cppstd, build flags from conf) into environment variables
NMake can understand: ``CL`` and ``_LINK_``.
It will also generate a ``conanvcvars.bat`` script that activates the correct VS prompt matching the
Conan host settings ``arch``, ``compiler`` and ``compiler.version``, and build settings ``arch``.

constructor
+++++++++++

.. code:: python

    def __init__(self, conanfile):

- ``conanfile``: the current recipe object. Always use ``self``.

Attributes
++++++++++

You can change some attributes before calling the ``generate()`` method if you want to inject more flags:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import NMakeToolchain

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def generate(self):
            tc = NMakeToolchain(self)
            tc.extra_cflags.append("/my_flag")
            tc.extra_defines.append("FOO=BAR")
            tc.generate()

* **extra_cflags** (Defaulted to ``[]``): Additional cflags.
* **extra_cxxflags** (Defaulted to ``[]``): Additional cxxflags.
* **extra_defines** (Defaulted to ``[]``): Additional defines.
* **extra_ldflags** (Defaulted to ``[]``): Additional ldflags.

conf
++++

``NMaketoolchain`` is affected by these :ref:`[conf]<global_conf>` variables:

- ``tools.build:cflags`` list of extra pure C flags that will be used by ``CL``.
- ``tools.build:cxxflags`` list of extra C++ flags that will be used by ``CL``.
- ``tools.build:defines`` list of preprocessor definitions that will be used by ``CL``.
- ``tools.build:sharedlinkflags`` list of extra linker flags that will be used by ``_LINK_``.
- ``tools.build:exelinkflags`` list of extra linker flags that will be used by ``_LINK_``.
- ``tools.build:compiler_executables`` dict-like Python object which specifies the compiler as key
  and the compiler executable path as value. Those keys will be mapped as follows:

  * ``asm``: will set ``AS`` in *conannmaketoolchain.sh|bat* script.
  * ``c``: will set ``CC`` in *conannmaketoolchain.sh|bat* script.
  * ``cpp``: will set ``CPP`` and ``CXX`` in *conannmaketoolchain.sh|bat* script.
  * ``rc``: will set ``RC`` in *conannmaketoolchain.sh|bat* script.

Customizing the environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your ``Makefile`` script needs some other environment variable rather than ``CL`` and ``_LINK_``, you can customize
it before calling the ``generate()`` method.
Call the ``environment()`` method to calculate the mentioned variables and then add the variables that you need.
The ``environment()`` method returns an :ref:`Environment<conan_tools_env_environment_model>` object:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import NMakeToolchain

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def generate(self):
            tc = NMakeToolchain(self)
            env = tc.environment()
            env.define("FOO", "BAR")
            tc.generate(env)

You can also inspect default environment variables NMakeToolchain will inject in *conannmaketoolchain.sh|bat* script:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.microsoft import NMakeToolchain

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"

        def generate(self):
            tc = NMakeToolchain(self)
            env_vars = tc.vars()
            cl_env_var = env_vars.get("CL")
