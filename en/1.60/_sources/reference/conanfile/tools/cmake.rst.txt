=================

.. important::

    This feature is still **under development**, while it is recommended and usable and we will try not to break them in future releases,
    some breaking changes might still happen if necessary to prepare for the *Conan 2.0 release*.

You can use ``conan new hello/0.1 --template=cmake_lib`` and ``conan new hello/0.1 --template=cmake_exe`` templates
to try this CMake integration.
