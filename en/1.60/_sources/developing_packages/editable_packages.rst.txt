Packages in editable mode
=========================

.. important::

    This is a **tutorial** section. You are encouraged to execute these commands.

    Some of the features used in this section are still **under development**, like ``layout()`` or ``CMakeToolchain``,
    while they are recommended and usable and we will try not to break them in future releases, some breaking
    changes might still happen if necessary to prepare for the *Conan 2.0 release*.

When working in big projects with several functionalities interconnected it is recommended to avoid
the one-and-only huge project approach in favor of several libraries, each one specialized
in a set of common tasks, even maintained by dedicated teams. This approach helps to isolate
and reusing code helps with compiling times and reduces the likelihood of including files that
not correspond to the API of the required library.

Nevertheless, in some case, it is useful to work in several libraries at the same time and see how
the changes in one of them are propagated to the others. With the normal flow, for every source change,
it is necessary to do ``conan create`` or ``conan export-pkg`` to put the package in the cache and
make it available to consumers.

With the editable packages, you can tell Conan where to find the headers and the artifacts ready for
consumption in your local working directory. There is no need to package.

Let's see this feature over a practical example, the code can be found in the examples repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/conan-io/examples.git
    $ cd examples/features/editable/cmake

There are 2 folders inside this project:

- A "say" folder containing a fully fledge package, with its ``conanfile.py``, its source code.
- A "hello" folder containing a simple consumer project with a ``conanfile.txt`` and its source code,
  which depends on the ``say/0.1@user/testing`` requirement.

The goal is to be able to build the "hello" project, without actually having the ``say/0.1@user/testing``
package in the cache, but directly in this project folder.

Put a package in editable mode
------------------------------

To avoid creating the package ``say/0.1@user/channel`` in the cache for every change, we are going
to put that package in editable mode, creating **a link from the reference in the cache to the local
working directory**:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan editable add say say/0.1@user/channel
    $ conan editable list
    say/0.1@user/channel
        Path: ...


That is it. Now, every usage of ``say/0.1@user/channel``, by any other Conan package or project,
will be redirected to the ``examples/features/editable/cmake/say`` user folder instead of using the package
from the conan cache.

Note that the key of editable packages is a correct definition of the ``layout()`` of the package. Read the
:ref:`package layout() section <package_layout>` to learn more about this method. 

In this example, the ``say`` ``conanfile.py`` recipe is using the predefined ``cmake_layout()`` which defines the
typical CMake project layout, which can be different in the different platforms. Take also into account that
only using the new build system integrations like ``CMakeDeps`` and ``CMakeToolchain`` will correctly follow
the layout definition.

Now the ``say/0.1@user/channel`` package is in editable mode, lets build it locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd say

    # windows, we will build 2 configurations to show multi-config
    $ conan install . -s build_type=Release
    $ conan install . -s build_type=Debug
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=generators/conan_toolchain.cmake
    $ cmake --build . --config Release
    $ cmake --build . --config Debug

    # Linux, we will only build 1 configuration
    $ conan install .
    $ cd build/Release
    $ cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=generators/conan_toolchain.cmake
    $ cmake --build .


Using a package in editable mode
--------------------------------

Consuming a package in editable mode is transparent from the consumer perspective.
In this case we can build the ``hello`` application as usual:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ../../hello

    # windows, we will build 2 configurations to show multi-config
    $ conan install . -s build_type=Release
    $ conan install . -s build_type=Debug
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=generators/conan_toolchain.cmake
    $ cmake --build . --config Release
    $ cmake --build . --config Debug
    $ Release\hello.exe
    say/0.1: Hello World Release!
    $ Debug\hello.exe
    say/0.1: Hello World Debug!

    # Linux, we will only build 1 configuration
    $ conan install .
    $ cd build/Release
    $ cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=generators/conan_toolchain.cmake
    $ cmake --build .
    $ ./hello
    say/0.1: Hello World Release!


Working with editable packages
------------------------------

Once the above steps have been done, we can basically work with our build system or IDE, no Conan involved,
and do changes in the editable packages and have those changes used by the consumers directly.
Lets see it, lets start by doing a change in the ``say`` source code:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ../../say
    # Edit src/say.cpp and change the error message from "Hello" to "Bye"

    # windows, we will build 2 configurations to show multi-config
    $ cd build
    $ cmake --build . --config Release
    $ cmake --build . --config Debug

    # Linux, we will only build 1 configuration
    $ cd build/Release
    $ cmake --build .


And build and run the "hello" project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ../../hello

    # windows,
    $ cd build
    $ cmake --build . --config Release
    $ cmake --build . --config Debug
    $ Release\hello.exe
    say/0.1: Bye World Release!
    $ Debug\hello.exe
    say/0.1: Bye World Debug!

    # Linux
    $ cd build/Release
    $ cmake --build .
    $ ./hello
    say/0.1: Bye World Release!


In that way, it is possible to be developing both the ``say`` library and the ``hello`` application, at the same
time, without any Conan command. If you had both open in the IDE, it would be just building one after the other.

.. note::

    When a package is in editable mode, most of the commands will not work. It is not possible to :command:`conan upload`,
    :command:`conan export` or :command:`conan create` when a package is in editable mode.


Revert the editable mode
------------------------

In order to revert the editable mode just remove the link using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan editable remove say/0.1@user/channel

It will remove the link (the local directory won't be affected) and all the packages consuming this
requirement will get it from the cache again.

.. warning::

   Packages that are built consuming an editable package in its graph upstreams can generate binaries
   and packages incompatible with the released version of the editable package. Avoid uploading
   these packages without re-creating them with the in-cache version of all the libraries.
