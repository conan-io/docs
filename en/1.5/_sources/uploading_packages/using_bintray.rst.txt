Using Bintray
-------------

On Bintray, you can create and manage as many free, personal Conan repositories as you like.
On an OSS account, all packages you upload are public, and anyone can use them by simply adding your
repository to their Conan remotes.

To allow collaboration on open source projects, you can also create
`Organizations <https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/BT/Bintray+Organizations>`_
in Bintray and add members who will be able to create and edit packages in your organization's
repositories.
