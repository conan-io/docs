Working with Intel compiler
===========================

The ``Intel`` compiler is a particular case, as it uses ``Visual Studio`` compiler in Windows environments
and ``gcc`` in Linux environments. If you are wondering how to manage the compatibility between the packages generated
with ``intel`` and the generated with the pure base compiler (``gcc`` or ``Visual Studio``) check the
:ref:`Compatible Packages<compatible_packages>` and :ref:`Compatible Compilers<compatible_compilers>` sections.
