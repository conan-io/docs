Road to Conan 2.0
=================

Conan has started to think about the next major release. We've been gathering feedback
from the community about our features and we think it's time to break some default
behaviors, clean the codebase and add space for new developments.

In the future, this section will contain relevant information and changes regarding Conan 2.0,
there is a lot of work ahead, as you can see in `our backlog <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/milestones>`_.

Meanwhile, in version 1.23 we have introduced an environment variable to activate new defaults and
best practices, and to detect things that are already almost deprecated. Read more about ``CONAN_V2_MODE``
in :ref:`this section <conan_v2_mode>` (this mode is only for developers and for testing purpose,
it doesn't expose a stable set of features and there is no stability commitment).

Stay tuned!
