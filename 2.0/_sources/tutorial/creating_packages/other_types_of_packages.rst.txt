Other types of packages
=======================

In the previous sections, we saw how to create a new recipe for a classic C++ library but there are other types 
of packages rather than libraries.

In this section, we are going to review how to create a recipe for ``header-only`` libraries, 
how to package already ``built libraries``, and how to create recipes for ``tool requires`` an ``applications``.
