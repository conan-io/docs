conan run
=========

.. autocommand::
    :command: conan run -h


The ``conan run`` command lets you directly execute a binary from a Conan package, automatically resolving and installing
all its dependencies. There’s no need to manually activate any environments generated by Conan: just pass the executable
to run, and Conan will activate the necessary environments and execute it.

The command can receive either a ``conanfile.py``/``conanfile.txt`` or have the requirements specified directly from the CLI via ``--requires`` and ``--tool-requires`` arguments.

For example, if we call a specific version of ``openssl`` we would:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan run "openssl --version" --tool-requires=openssl/3.5.4

    Installing and building dependencies, this might take a while...

This command is useful when you want to execute some specific binary from any package.

.. note::
    This command activates both the ``host`` and ``build`` contexts, so that both contexts binaries are made available at once.
    In case that a package exists in both contexts, the ``host`` context binaries take precedence.
