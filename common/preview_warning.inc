.. note::

    This feature is in **preview**. It means that it is very unlikely to be removed and unlikely to have
    breaking changes. Maintainers will try as much as possible to not break it, and only do it if
    very necessary.
    See :ref:`the Conan stability<stability>` section for more information.
