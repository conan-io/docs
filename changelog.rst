0.13.0 (03-October-2016)
---------------------------

**IMPORTANT UPGRADE ISSUE:** There was a small error in the computation of binary packages IDs, that
has been addressed by conan 0.13. It affects to third level (and higher) package binaries, i.e. A
and B in A->B->C->D, which binaries **must** be regenerated for the new hashes. If you don't plan
to provide support for older conan releases (<=0.12), which would be reasonable, you should remove
all binaries first (``conan remove -p``, works both locally and remotely), then re-build your binaries.

Features:

- Streaming from/to disk for all uploads/downloads. Previously, this was done for memory, but conan
  started to have issues for huge packages (>many hundreds Mbs), that sometimes could be alleviated
  using Python 64 bits distros. This issues should be alleviated now
- New security system that allows capturing and checking the package recipes and binaries manifests
  into user folders (project or any other folder). That ensures that packages cannot be replaced,
  hacked, forged, changed or wrongly edited, either locally or in any remote server, without notice.
- Possible to handle and reuse python code in recipes. Actually, conan can be used as a package
  manager for python, by adding the package path to ``env_info.PYTHONPATH``. Useful if you want to
  reuse common python code between different package recipes.
- Avoiding re-compress the tgz for packages after uploads if it didn't change.
- New command ``conan source`` that executes the ``source()`` method of a given conanfile. Very
  useful for CI, if desired to run in parallel the construction of different binaries.
- New propagation of ``cpp_info``, so it now allows for capturing binary package libraries with new
  ``collect_libs()`` helper, and access to created binaries to compute the ``package_info()`` in general.
- Command ``test_package`` now allows the ``--update`` option, to automatically update dependencies.
- Added new architectures for ``ppc64le`` and detection for ``AArch64``
- New methods for defining requires effect over binary package ID (hash) in ``conan_info()``
- Many bugs fixes: error in ``tools.download`` with python 3, restore correct prompt in virtualenvs,
  bug if removing an option in ``config_options()``, setup.py bug...
  
This release has contributions from @tru, @raulbocanegra, @tivek, @mathieu, and the feedback of many
other conan users, thanks very much to all of them!



0.12.0 (13-September-2016)
-----------------------------
- Major changes to **search** api and commands. Decoupled the search of package recipes, from the
  search of package binaries.
- Fixed bug that didn't allow to ``export`` or ``upload`` packages with settings restrictions if the
  restrictions didn't match the host settings
- Allowing disabling color output with ``CONAN_COLOR_DISPLAY=0`` environment variable, or to configure
  color schema for light console backgrounds with ``CONAN_COLOR_DARK=1`` environment variable
- Imports can use absolute paths, and files copied from local conan cache to those paths will not
  be removed when ``conan install``. Can be used as a way to install machine-wise things (outside
  conan local cache)
- More robust handling of failing transfers (network disconnect), and inconsistent status after such
- Large internal refactor for storage managers. Improved implementations and decoupling between
  server and client
- Fixed slow ``conan remove`` for caches with many packages due to slow deletion of empty folders
- Always allowing explicit options scopes, ``- o Package:option=value`` as well as the implicit
  ``-o option=value`` for current ``Package``, for consistency
- Fixed some bugs in client-server auth process.
- Allow to extract ``.tar`` files in ``tools.unzip()``
- Some helpers for ``conan_info()``, as ``self.info.requires.clear()`` and removal of settings and options


0.11.1 (31-August-2016)
-----------------------
- New error reporting for failures in conanfiles, including line number and offending line, much
  easier for package creators
- Removed message requesting to create an account in ``conan.io`` for other remotes
- Removed localhost:9300 remote that was added by default mostly for demo purposes. Clarified in docs.
- Fixed usernames case-sensitivity in conan_server, due to ConfigParser it was forcing lowercase
- Handling unicode characters in remote responses, fixed crash
- Added new compilers gcc 6.2, clang 8.0 to the default ``settings.yml``
- Bumped cryptography, boto and other conan dependencies, mostly for ArchLinux compatibility and
  new OSX security changes


0.11.0 (3-August-2016)
-----------------------
- New solution for the path length limit in Windows, more robust and complete. Package conanfile.py
  just have to declare an attribute ``short_paths=True`` and everything will be managed. The old
  approach is deprecated and totally removed, so no shorts_paths.conf file is necessary. It should
  fix also the issues with uploads/retrievals.
- New ``virtualenv`` generator that generates ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` scripts that set
  environment variables in the current shell. It is very useful, for example to install tools
  (like CMake, MinGW) with conan packages, so multiple versions can be installed in the same machine,
  and switch between them just by activating such virtual environments. Packages for MinGW and CMake
  are already available as a demo
- ConfigureEnvironment takes into account environment variables, defined in packages in new ``env_info``,
  which is similar to ``cpp_info`` but for environment information (like paths).
- New per-package **build_policy**, which can be set to ``always`` or ``missing``, so it is not
  necessary to create packages or specify the ``--build`` parameter in command line. Useful for example
  in header only libraries or to create packages that always get the latest code from a branch in a github
  repository.
- Command ``conan test_package`` now executes by default a ``conan export`` with smarter package
  reference deduction. It is introduced as opt-out behavior.
- Conan ``export`` command avoids copying ``test_package/build`` temporary files in case of ``export=*``
- Now, ``package_info()`` allows absolute paths in ``includedir``, ``libdirs`` and ``bindirs``, so
  wrapper packages can be defined that use system or manually installed libraries.
- LDFLAGS in ``ConfigureEnvironment`` management of OSX frameworks.
- Options allow the ``ANY`` value, so such option would accept any value. For example a commit of a
  git repository, useful to create packages that can build any specific commit of a git repo.
- Added gcc 5.4 to the default settings, as well as MinGW options (Exceptions, threads...)
- Command ``conan info`` learned a new option to output the packages from a project dependency tree that
  should be rebuilt in case of a modification of a certain package. It outputs a machine readable **ordered**
  list of packages to be built in that order. Useful for CI systems.
- Better management of incomplete, dirty or failed ``source`` directories (e.g. in case of a user
  interrupting with Ctrl+C a git clone inside the ``source()`` method.
- Added tools for easier detection of different OS versions and distributions, as well as command
  wrappers to install system packages (apt, yum). They use ``sudo`` via a new environment variable
  CONAN_SYSREQUIRES_SUDO, so using sudo is opt-in/out, for users with different sudo needs. Useful for ``system_requirements()``
- Deprecated the ``config()`` method (still works, for backwards compatibility), but has been replaced
  by a ``config_options()`` to modify options based on settings, and a ``configure()`` method for
  most use cases. This removes a nasty behaviour of having the ``config()`` method called twice with 
  side effects.
- Now, running a ``conan install MyLib/0.1@user/channel`` to directly install packages without any
  consuming project, is also able to generate files with the ``-g`` option. Useful for installing
  tool packages (MinGW, CMake) and generate ``virtualenvs``.
- Many small fixes and improvements: detect compiler bug in Py3, search was crashing for remotes,
  conan new failed if the package name had a dash, etc.
- Improved some internal duplications of code, refactored many tests. 

This has been a big release. Practically 100% of the released features are thanks to active users
feedback and contributions. Thanks very much again to all of them!



0.10.0 (29-June-2016)
-------------------------
- **conan new** command, that creates conan package conanfile.py templates, with a ``test_package`` package test (-t option),
  also for header only packages (-i option)
- Definition of **scopes**. There is a default **dev** scope for the user project, but any other scope (test, profile...) can be defined and used in packages. They can be used to fire extra processes (as running tests), but they do not affect the package binares, and are not included in the package IDs (hash).
- Definition of **dev_requires**. Those are requirements that are only retrieved when the package is in **dev** scope, otherwise they are not. They do not affect the package binaries. Typical use cases would be test libraries or build scripts.
- Allow **shorter paths** for specific packages, which can be necessary to build packages with very long path names (e.g. Qt) in Windows.
- Support for bzip2 and gzip decompression in ``tools``
- Added ``package_folder`` attribute to conanfile, so the ``package()`` method can for example call ``cmake install`` to create the package.
- Added ``CONAN_CMAKE_GENERATOR`` environment variable that allows to override the ``CMake`` default generator. That can be useful to build with Ninja instead of the default Unix Makefiles
- Improved ``ConfigureEnvironment`` with include paths in CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS, and fixed bug.
- New ``conan user --clean`` option, to completely remove all user data for all remotes.
- Allowed to raise ``Exceptions`` in ``config()`` method, so it is easier for package creators to raise under non-supported configurations
- Fixed many small bugs and other small improvements

As always, thanks very much to all contributors and users providing feedback.

0.9.2 (11-May-2016)
-------------------
- **Fixed download bug** that made it specially slow to download, even crash. Thanks to github @melmdk for fixing it.
- **Fixed cmake check of CLang**, it was being skipped
- **Improved performance**. Check for updates has been removed from install, made it opt-in in ``conan info`` command, as it
  was very slow, seriously affecting performance of large projects.
- Improved internal representation of graph, also improves performance for large projects.
- Fixed bug in ``conan install --update``


0.9 (3-May-2016)
-------------------

- **Python 3** "experimental" support. Now the main conan codebase is Python 2 and 3 compatible. 
  Python 2 still the reference platform, Python 3 stable support in next releases.
- Create and share your **own custom generators for any build system or tool**. With "generator packages",
  you can write a generator just as any other package, upload it, modify and version it, etc. Require
  them by reference, as any other package, and pull it into your projects dynamically.
- **Premake4** initial experimental support via a generator package. Check https://www.conan.io/source/PremakeGen/0.1/memsharded/testing
- Very large **re-write of the documentation**. New "creating packages" sections with in-source and out-source explicit examples.
  Please read it! :)
- Improved ``conan test``. Renamed ``test`` to ``test_package`` both for the command and the folder,
  but backwards compatibility remains. Custom folder name also possible. 
  **Adapted test layout** might require minor changes to your package test, 
  automatic warnings added for your convenience.
- Upgraded pyinstaller to generate binary OS installers from 2.X to 3.1
- ``conan search`` now has command line options:, less verbose, verbose, extra verbose
- Added variable with full list of dependencies in conanbuildinfo.cmake
- Several minor bugfixes (check github issues)
- Improved ``conan user`` to manage user login to multiple remotes


0.8.4 (28-Mar-2016)
-------------------

- Fixed linker problems with the new apple-clang 7.3 due to libraries with no setted timestamp.
- Added apple-clang 7.3 to default settings
- Fixed default libcxx for apple-clang in auto detection of base conan.conf


0.8 (15-Mar-2016)
-----------------

- New **conan remote** command to manage remotes. Redesigned remotes architecture, now allows
  to work with several remotes in a more consistent, powerful and "git-like" way. New remotes
  registry keeps track of the remote of every installed package, and this information is shown
  in ``conan info`` command too. Also, it keeps different user logins for different remotes, to
  improve support in corporate environments running in-house servers.
- New **update** functionality. Now it is possible to ``conan install --update`` to update packages
  that became obsolete because new ones were uploaded to the corresponding remote. Conan commands
  as install and info show information about the status of the local packages compared with the
  remote ones. In this way, using latest versions during development is much more natural.
- Added new **compiler.libcxx** setting in order to support the different c++ standard libraries.
  It can take libstdc++, libstdc++11 or libc++ values to take into account different standard
  libraries for modern gcc and clang compilers. It is also possible to remove not needed settings,
  like this one in pure C projects, with the new syntax: ``del self.settings.compiler.libcxx``
- Conan **virtual environment**: Define a custom conan directory with **CONAN_USER_HOME** env variable,
  and have a per project or per workspace storage for your dependencies. So you can isolate your
  dependencies and even bundle them within your project, by just setting the CONAN_USER_HOME
  variable to your ``<project>/deps`` folder, for example. This also improves support for continuous
  integration CI systems, in which many builds from different users could be run in parallel.
- Better conanfile download method. More stable and now checks (opt-out) the **ssl certificates**.
- Lots of improvements: Increased library name length limit, Improved and cleaner output messages.
- Fixed several minor bugs: removing empty folders, case sensitive exports, arm settings detection.
- Introduced the concept of **"package recipe"** that refers to conanfile.py and exported files.
- Improved settings display in web, with new "copy install command to clipboard" to assist in
  installing packages discovered in web.
- The OSX installer, problematic with latest OSX releases, has been deprecated in favour
  of homebrew and pip install procedures.



0.7 (5-Feb-2016)
----------------

- Custom conanfile names are allowed for developing. With ``--file`` option you can define
  the file you want to use, allowing for ``.conaninfo.txt`` or having multiple ``conanfile_dev.py``,
  ``conanfile_test.py`` besides the standard ``conanfile.py`` which is used for sharing the package.
  Inheritance is allowed, e.g. ``conanfile_dev.py`` might extend/inherit from ``conanfile.py``.
- New ``conan copy`` command that can be used to copy/rename packages, promote them between channels,
  forking other users packages.
- New ``--all`` and ``--package`` options for ``conan install`` that allows to download one, several,
  or all package configurations for a given reference.
- Added ``patch()`` tool to easily patch sources if necessary.
- New **qmake** and **qbs** generators
- Upload of conanfile **exported** files is also **tgz'd**, allowing fast upload/downloads of
  full sources if desired, avoiding retrieval of sources from externals sources.
- ``conan info`` command improved showing info of current project too
- Output of ``run()`` can be redirected to buffer string for processing, or even removed.
- Added **proxy** configuration to conan.conf for users behinds proxies.
- Large improvements in commands output, prefixed with package reference, and much clear.
- Updated settings for more versions of gcc and new arm architectures
- Treat dependencies includes as SYSTEM in cmake, so no warnings are raised
- Deleting source folder after ``conan export`` so no manual removal is needed
- Normalizing to CRLF generated user files in Win
- Better detection and checks for compilers as VS, apple-clang
- Fixed CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS typo in cmake files
- Large internal refactor in generators


0.6 (11-Jan-2016)
-----------------

- New cmake variables in cmake generator to make FindPackage work better thanks to the underlaying FindLibrary. Now many FindXXX.cmake work "as-is" and the package creator does not have to create a custom override, and consumers can use packages transparently with the originals FindXXX.cmakes
- New "conan info" command that shows the full dependency graph and details (license, author, url, dependants, dependencies) for each dependency.
- New environment helper with a ConfigureEnvironment class, that is able to translate conan information to autotools configure environment definition
- Relative importing from conanfiles now is possible. So if you have common functionality between different packages, you can reuse those python files by importing them from the conanfile.py. Note that export="..." might be necessary, as packages as to be self-contained.
- Added YouCompleteMe generator for vim auto-completion of dependencies.
- New "conanfile_directory" property that points to the file in which the conanfile.py is located. This helps if using the conanfile.py "build" method to build your own project as a project, not a package, to be able to use any workflow, out-of-source builds, etc.
- Many edits and improvements in help, docs, output messages for many commands.
- All cmake syntax in modern lowercase
- Fixed several minor bugs: gcc detection failure when gcc not installed, missing import, copying source->build failing when symlinks


0.5 (18-Dec-2015)
-----------------

- New cmake functionality allows package creators to provide cmake finders, so that package consumers
  can use their CMakeLists.txt with typical FindXXX.cmake files, without any change to them. CMake CONAN_CMAKE_MODULES_PATH
  added, so that package creators can provide any additional cmake scripts for consumers.
- Now it is possible to generate out-of-source and multiple configuration installations for the
  same project, so you can switch between them without having to ``conan install`` again. Check :ref:`the new workflows<workflows>`
- New qmake generator (thanks @dragly)
- Improved removal/deletion of folders with shutil.rmtree, so ``conan remove`` commands and other
  processes requiring deletion of folders do not fail due to permissions and require manual deletion.
  This is an improvement, especially in Win.
- Created ``pip`` package, so conan can be installed via: ``pip install conan``
- Released ``pyinstaller`` code for the creation of binaries from conan python source code. Distros package creators can
  create packages for the conan apps easily from those binaries.
- Added md5, sha1, sha256 helpers in ``tools``, so external downloads from ``conanfile.py`` files ``source()``
  can be checked.
- Added latest gcc versions to default ``settings.yml``
- Added CI support for conan development: travis-ci, appveyor
- Improved human-readability for download progress, help messages.
- Minor bug fixes
