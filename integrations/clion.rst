Introducing the new CLion Conan Plugin compatible with 2.X
==========================================================

In this post, we are thrilled to announce the launch of the new version of the Conan CLion
Plugin, now compatible with the 2.X versions of Conan. The new plugin is designed to bring
more ease and control to developers using CLion (with version higher than 2022.3) and
Conan for C++ projects. We will walk you through the process of using this plugin with a
practical example that uses `libcurl <https://curl.se/libcurl/>`_ and `stb
<https://github.com/nothings/stb>`_ to download an image from the Internet, load it, and
print it as ASCII art in the console.

How the plugin works
--------------------

Before explaining how to install, configure, and use the plugin, let's briefly discuss how
it integrates Conan with CMake to create a seamless experience. This plugin utilizes
`cmake-conan <https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan/tree/develop2>`_, a `CMake
dependency provider
<https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/using-dependencies/index.html#dependency-providers>`_
for the Conan C and C++ package manager. It injects ``conan_provider.cmake`` using the
``CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES`` definition. This dependency provider will translate
the CMake configuration to Conan. For instance, if you select a *Debug* profile in CLion,
Conan will install and use the packages for *Debug*. Bear in mind that *cmake-conan*
activates the Conan integration every time CMake calls to ``find_package()``, meaning that
no library will be installed until the CMake configure step runs. At that point, Conan
will try to install the required libraries and build them if needed. Also, note that as
dependency providers are a relatively new feature in CMake, you will need CMake version >=
3.24 and Conan >= 2.0.5.

Installing the plugin
---------------------

To install the new Conan CLion plugin, navigate to the JetBrains marketplace. Open CLion,
go to *Settings > Plugins*, then select the *Marketplace* tab. Search for the Conan plugin
and click on the Install button. After restarting CLion, a new ‚ÄúConan‚Äù tool tab will
appear at the bottom of the IDE.

Creating a new CMake project
----------------------------

First, create a new CMake project in CLion, as usual. Then select the project location and
the language standard you want to use, and click on "Create".

Configuring the plugin
----------------------

Go to the ‚ÄúConan‚Äù tool tab at the bottom of the IDE. You will see that the only enabled
action in the toolbar of the plugin is the one with the ‚öôÔ∏è (wheel) symbol, click on it.
The first thing you should do there is configuring the Conan client executable that's
going to be used. You can point to one specifically installed in an arbitrary location on
your system or you can select *"Use Conan installed in the system"* to use the one
installed at the system level. You will find there some options marked as default. Let's
go through all of them.

- First, you will see checkboxes to mark in which configurations Conan should manage the
  dependencies. In our case, as we only have the Debug configuration, it's the only one
  checked. Also, below that "Automatically add Conan support for all configurations" is
  marked by default. That means that you don't have to worry about adding Conan support to
  new build configurations because the plugin will automatically add Conan support by
  default.
- You can also see that there's a checkbox to let Conan change the default CLion settings
  and run CMake sequentially instead of running it in parallel. This is needed as the
  Conan cache is not yet concurrent up to Conan 2.0.9 version. Normally, if you are using
  the Conan plugin, you wouldn't want to unmark them. So leave them and let's create our
  project and add the libraries to it. So, click on the OK button and the plugin should be
  ready to use.

**Note:** At this point, CLion will run the configure step for CMake automatically. Since
the plugin sets up the *conan.cmake* dependency provider, a warning will appear in the
CMake output indicating that we have not added a `find_package()` to our *CMakeLists.txt*
yet. This warning will disappear after we add the necessary `find_package()` calls to the
*CMakeLists.txt* file. After doing the initial configuration, you will notice that the
list of libraries is now enabled and that the üîÑ (update) and üëÅÔ∏è (inspect) symbols are
also enabled. We will explain them later in detail.

Using the plugin
----------------

Now that we have our plugin configured and ready, let's explore its usage with an example.
For this, we will use `libcurl <https://curl.se/libcurl/>`_ to download an image from the
Internet, then `stb <https://github.com/nothings/stb>`_ to load it, and some basic code to
print it in the console as ASCII characters. We will not delve into the specific details
of the code, as it is beyond the scope of this tutorial. However, all the source code for
this example is available in the `Conan 2.0 examples repo
<https://github.com/conan-io/examples2/tree/main/examples/libraries/libcurl/download_image>`_.

Adding the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, open the *main.cpp* file that CLion generated and replace the example code with the
code below (you can also copy it from the `repository
<https://github.com/conan-io/examples2/tree/main/examples/libraries/libcurl/download_image/main.cpp>`_):

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include
   #include
   #define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
   #include
   // Size of ASCII art
   static const int new_width = 100;
   // Ascii gradient
   static const std::string ASCII_CHARS = " .:-=+#%@@"; // Inverted colors
   // Function to scale the luminance into an ASCII character
   char map_luminance_to_ascii(float luminance) {
     size_t position = luminance * (ASCII_CHARS.size() - 1);
     return ASCII_CHARS[position];
   }
   // Function to download image
   static size_t write_data(void* ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void* stream) {
     ((std::string*)stream)->append((char*)ptr, size * nmemb);
     return size * nmemb;
   }
   std::string download_image(const std::string& url) {
     CURL* curl = curl_easy_init();
     std::string response_string;
     curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url.c_str());
     curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);
     curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &response_string);
     curl_easy_perform(curl);
     curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
     return response_string;
   }
   // Function to convert image to ASCII
   std::string image_to_ascii(const std::string& image_data) {
     int width, height, channels;
     unsigned char* data = stbi_load_from_memory(
       reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(image_data.data()),
       image_data.size(),
       &width, &height, &channels, 0
     );
     int new_height = static_cast<int>(static_cast<float>(height) / width * new_width * 0.45);
     std::string ascii_image;
     for (int i = 0; i < new_height; ++i) {
       for (int j = 0; j < new_width; ++j) {
         int old_i = i * height / new_height;
         int old_j = j * width / new_width;
         float r = data[(old_i * width + old_j) * channels + 0] / 255.0f;
         float g = data[(old_i * width + old_j) * channels + 1] / 255.0f;
         float b = data[(old_i * width + old_j) * channels + 2] / 255.0f;
         float luminance = (0.2126f * r + 0.7152f * g + 0.0722f * b);
         // Subtract the luminance from 1 to invert
         ascii_image += map_luminance_to_ascii(luminance);
       }
       ascii_image += '\n';
     }
     stbi_image_free(data);
     return ascii_image;
   }
   int main(int argc, char** argv) {
     // Picture by Katarzyna Modrzejewska from pexels.com
     std::string url = "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1314550/pexels-photo-1314550.jpeg";
     if (argc > 1) {
       url = argv[1];
     }
     std::string image_data = download_image(url);
     std::cout << image_to_ascii(image_data);
   }

Essentially, this application accepts an image URL as an argument (or defaults to a
specific one if not provided), and downloads it using *libcurl* with the
``download_image()`` function. Subsequently, it reads the RGB values with *stb* and
converts the luminance values to ASCII characters using the ``image_to_ascii()`` function.
Currently, attempting to build this code will result in an error because we don't have the
required libraries yet. Navigate to the library list and search for *libcurl*. Some
information on how to add it to CMake will be displayed, along with a "Use in project"
button. Select the version you want to use and click the button. Perform the same
operation for *stb*. Now, if you click on the üëÅÔ∏è (inspect) icon mentioned earlier, you
will see all the libraries we added to the project. This includes basic target information
for CMake and the necessary code snippets to add to CMake to use them. Conan stores
information about the used packages in a *conandata.yml* file located in your project
folder. This file is read by a *conanfile.py*, also created during this process. These
files can be customized for advanced usage of the plugin, but please read the information
in the corresponding files on how to do this properly. Modify your *CMakeLists.txt*
according to the instructions, which should result in something like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
   project(ascii_image)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
   find_package(CURL)
   find_package(stb)
   add_executable(ascii_image main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(ascii_image CURL::libcurl stb::stb)

After reloading the CMake project, you should see Conan installing the libraries in the
CMake output tab. Once the configuration process is complete, you can build and run the
project.

Conclusions
-----------

The new Conan CLion plugin, compatible with 2.X versions, is designed to provide seamless
integration between the Conan package manager and the CLion IDE. The plugin offers a more
intuitive interface, making it easier to manage your dependencies directly within CLion.
We hope this tool enhances your development experience, and we eagerly await to see what
you will build with it!
