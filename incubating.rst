Incubating features
===================

This section is dedicated to new features that are under development, looking for user testing and feedback.
They are generally behind a flag to enable them to be explicitly opted-in at this testing stage. They require the very latest
Conan version (sometimes recommended running from the ``develop2`` source branch), and explicitly setting those flags.
