.. _template_command_new:


Package scaffolding for :command:`conan new` command
====================================================

.. warning::

    This functionality has to be considered as an **experimental** feature. We might
    change the context provided for these templates once we have more examples
    from the community.

Using the Conan command :command:`conan new` is a very convenient way to start a new project with an
example `conanfile.py`. This command has a ``--template`` argument that you can use to provide a path
to a template file for the ``conanfile.py`` itself or even a path to a folder containing files for a
C++ project using Conan recipes.

The argument ``--template`` can take an absolute path or a relative path. If relative, Conan will look
for the files starting in the Conan cache folder ``templates/command/new/``. This is very useful in
combination with :ref:`conan_config_install` because you can easily share these templates with all
your team.

.. note::

    For backwards compatibility reasons, if the ``--template`` argument takes the path to a single file
    Conan will look for it in the cache at the path ``templates/<filename>`` first. This will likely be
    removed in Conan v2.0.

This mechanism lets you have the Conan cache templates containing not only a *conanfile.py*, but the
full C++ project scaffolding. Thus just a single command can get you started:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan new mypackage/version --template=header_only
    $ conan new mypackage/version --template=conan-center

Conan will process all the files found in that folder using `Jinja2 engine <https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/>`_
and also the paths to those files. Thus the following template directory (that does match the conventions for
`conan-center-index <https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes>`_ recipes):

.. code-block:: text

    conan-center/{{name}}/config.yml
                /{{name}}/all/conanfile.py
                /{{name}}/all/conandata.yml
                /{{name}}/all/test_package/conanfile.py
                /{{name}}/all/test_package/CMakeLists.txt
                /{{name}}/all/test_package/main.cpp

will be translated to:

.. code-block:: text

    conan-center/mypackage/config.yml
                /mypackage/all/conanfile.py
                /mypackage/all/conandata.yml
                /mypackage/all/test_package/conanfile.py
                /mypackage/all/test_package/CMakeLists.txt
                /mypackage/all/test_package/main.cpp

Then the contents of all the files will be rendered using Jinja2 syntax as well,
thus substituting content values with context values - as we will see in the next section.

Context
-------

All the files should be valid Jinja2 templates. They will be feed with the following context:

- ``name`` and ``version``: defined from the command line.
- ``package_name``: a *CamelCase* variant of the name.
  Any valid Conan package name like ``package_name``, ``package+name``, ``package.name`` or
  ``package-name`` will be converted into a suitable name for a Python class, ``PackageName``.
- ``conan_version``: an object that renders as the current Conan version, e.g. ``1.24.0``.

Example
-------

This is a very simple example for a header only library:

  .. code-block:: text

    # Recipe autogenerated with Conan {{ conan_version }} using `conan new --template` command

    from conans import ConanFile


    class {{package_name}}Conan(ConanFile):
        name = "{{ name }}"
        version = "{{ version }}"
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        exports_sources = "include/*"

        def package(self):
            self.copy("*.hpp", dst="include")
            self.copy("LICENSE.txt", dst="licenses")

        def package_id(self):
            self.info.header_only()

Custom definitions
------------------

Sometimes it's needed to provide additional variables for the custom templates. For instance, if
it's desired to have ``description`` and ``homepage`` to be templated as well:

  .. code-block:: text

    # Recipe autogenerated with Conan {{ conan_version }} using `conan new --template` command

    from conans import ConanFile


    class {{package_name}}Conan(ConanFile):
        name = "{{ name }}"
        version = "{{ version }}"
        description = "{{ description }}"
        homepage = "{{ homepage }}"
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        exports_sources = "include/*"

        def package(self):
            self.copy("*.hpp", dst="include")
            self.copy("LICENSE.txt", dst="licenses")

        def package_id(self):
            self.info.header_only()

With the above template it's now easy to overwrite such extra keywords with values from the command line:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ conan new mypackage/version --template=header_only -d homepage=https://www.example.com -d description="the best package"

Predefined templates
--------------------

Available since: `1.40.0 <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.40.0>`_

The Conan client has some predefined templates that can be used with the command ``new``.
These two templates are related to :ref:`Layouts<conan_tools_layout_predefined_layouts>` and offer a simple Hello World example:

* `cmake_lib`: Generates a hello world c++ library based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using CMake as the build system.
* `cmake_exe`: Generates a hello world executable based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using CMake as the build system.
* `msbuild_lib`: Generates a hello world c++ library based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using MSBuild as the build system.
* `msbuild_exe`: Generates a hello world executable based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using MSBuild as the build system.
* `meson_lib`: Generates a hello world c++ library based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using Meson as the build system (since Conan 1.45).
* `meson_exe`: Generates a hello world executable based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using Meson as the build system (since Conan 1.45).
* `bazel_lib`: Generates a hello world c++ library based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using Bazel as the build system (since Conan 1.47).
* `bazel_exe`: Generates a hello world executable based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using Bazel as the build system (since Conan 1.47).
* `autotools_lib`: Generates a hello world c++ library based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using Autotools as the build system (since Conan 1.48).
* `autotools_exe`: Generates a hello world executable based on modern Conan recipe (layout + generate) using Autotools as the build system (since Conan 1.48).

A full example can be found in :ref:`Creating Packages<packaging_getting_started>` section.
