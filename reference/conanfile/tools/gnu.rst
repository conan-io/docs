.. _make_toolchain:

conan.tools.gnu
===============

.. warning::

    This is an **experimental** feature subject to breaking changes in future releases.

MakeToolchain
-------------

The `MakeToolchain` can be used in the ``generate()`` method of ``conanfile.py``:

.. code:: python

    from conans import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.gnu import MakeToolchain

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        requires = "hello/0.1"
        options = {"shared": [True, False], "fPIC": [True, False]}
        default_options = {"shared": False, "fPIC": True}

        def generate(self):
            tc = MakeToolchain(self)
            tc.generate()


The ``MakeToolchain`` will generate the following file during ``conan install``
command (or before calling the ``build()`` method when the package is being
built in the cache): ``conan_toolchain.mak``. To use the variables generated by
Conan, include this file in your existing ``Makefile`` such as:

.. code:: makefile

    include conan_toolchain.mak

Or to make it optional:


.. code:: makefile

    -include conan_toolchain.mak


``conan_toolchain.mak`` will contain the definitions of all the Make variables
related to the Conan options and settings for the current package, platform,
etc. This includes but is not limited to the following:

* Detection of target type: "executable", "shared" or "static"

  * Based on existance/value of a option named ``shared``

  * Based on result, defines ``-shared`` linker flag

* Detection of ``fPIC``

  * Based on existance/value of a option named ``fPIC``

  * Combines with detection of target type above

  * Sets ``-fPIC`` flag for compiler

  * Sets ``-fPIC`` flag for linker when building shared library

  * Sets ``-pie`` flag for linker when building executable

* Detection of ``build_type`` from Conan settings

  * Sets -DNDEBUG flag for ``Release`` builds

* Definition of the C++ standard as necessary

* Definition of the standard library used for C++

* Definition of rpaths based on libpaths in conan cache

**NOTE**: Simply including this file will have no effect on your ``Makefile``
build.

All variables in this file are prefixed with ``CONAN_TC_`` and so existing
makefiles will robably makes no references to variables with these names. Users
can modify their makefiles to make use of these variables by name.  That is
certainly supported, however such a process tighly couples Makefiles to Conan
which can be undesirable, so Conan provides an alternative. There is list of
well-known "standard"/"conventional" variables used within **GnuMake**,
**Autotools**, and other related tools:

`Gnu Make Well-Known Variables <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html>`_

The relevant content from the GnuMake manual is provided here for convenience:

  CFLAGS
  Extra flags to give to the C compiler.

  CXXFLAGS
  Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler.

  CPPFLAGS
  Extra flags to give to the C preprocessor and programs that use it (the C and Fortran compilers).

  LDFLAGS Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the
  linker, ‘ld’, such as -L. Libraries (-lfoo) should be added to the LDLIBS
  variable instead.

  LDLIBS
  Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the
  linker, ‘ld’. LOADLIBES is a deprecated (but still supported) alternative to
  LDLIBS. Non-library linker flags, such as -L, should go in the LDFLAGS
  variable.

To have the ``CONAN_TC_`` variables appended to these standard GnuMake
variables, simply add the following function call to your ``Makefile`` somewhere
after the ``include`` statement:

* ``$(call CONAN_TC_SETUP)``

To be clear, this only has the desired "automatic" effect if your
``Makefile(s)`` all use of these standard variables in the conventional way.  If
your ``Makefile(s)``  use custom variables, you would need to teach them to
append/include/use the ``CONAN_TC_`` variables manually.

Also, while we are appending "standard" variables in a seemingly sensible way,
this function makes a lot of assumptions which are likely not going to hold true
in many environments. The goal is to make as much of the behavior configurable
as possible. Based on user requests, we will continue to add parameters to the
constructor. If you would like a behavior added to the list of configurable
items, please provide feedback at: https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues


definitions
+++++++++++

This attribute allows defining preprocessor definitions the same way that build helpers do:

.. code:: python

    def generate(self):
        tc = MakeToolchain(self)
        tc.preprocessor_definitions["MYVAR"] = "MyValue"
        tc.generate()

This will be translated to:

- ``-DMYVAR=MYVAL`` being appended to the ``CONAN_TC_CPPFLAGS`` variable


generators
++++++++++

The ``MakeGenerator`` is being developed in-tandem with this toolchain because
ideally they would be used in the same recipes and workflows. They have
consistent conventions and strategy, however they are currently completely
independent from each other. Thus, you can use this toolchain without using the
``MakeGenerator``.


Using the toolchain in developer flow
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

One of the advantages of using Conan toolchains is that it provides
exact same "toolchain-related" variables that Conan will have within a recipe's
``build()`` method to the build system when the user calls the build system
directly in their workspace. This was not possible prior to Conan's toolchain
feature. Here's an example:

.. code:: bash

    # Lets start in the folder containing a conanfile.py
    # Add the toolchain method with the MakeToolchain as shown in the example
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    # Install both debug and release deps and create the toolchain
    $ conan install ..
    # Add the following lines to Makefile:
    #    -include build/conan_toolchain.mak
    #    $(call CONAN_TC_SETUP)
    $ make

**NOTE** As stated previously, this will only have the desired effect if the
``Makefile`` makes conventional use of the standard variables.

We can actually achieve the same goal without modifying the ``Makefile`` at all,
it simply requires passing a few more parameters to **GnuMake**.

.. code:: bash

    $ conan install ..
    $ make -E='include build/conan_toolchain.mak' -E='$(call CONAN_TC_SETUP)'
