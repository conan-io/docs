    This is **only** for executable Python packages and its Python dependencies.
    This approach doesn't work for Python library packages that you would typically use via ``import`` inside your recipe.

The ``PipEnv`` helper installs executable Python packages with **pip** inside a dedicated virtual environment (**venv**),
keeping them isolated so they don't interfere with system packages or the Conan package itself.
It is designed to use a Python CLI tool inside a recipe during the build step.

Using a Python package in a recipe
----------------------------------

To use a tool installed with Python, we have to install it using the ``PipEnv.install()`` method.
We also have to call the ``PipEnv.generate()`` method to create a **Conan Environment** that adds the **Python virtualenv path** to the system path.

These two steps appear in the following recipe in the ``generate()`` method.
Calling it in this method ensures that the **Python package** and the **Conan Environment** will be available in the following steps.
In this case, in the build step, which is where we will use the installed tool.

..  code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.system import PipEnv
    from conan.tools.layout import basic_layout


    class PipPackage(ConanFile):
        name = "pip_install"
        version = "0.1"

        def layout(self):
            basic_layout(self)

        def generate(self):
            PipEnv(self).install(["meson==1.9.1"])
            PipEnv(self).generate()

        def build(self):
            self.run("meson --version")

If we run a ``conan build`` we can see how our Python package is installed when the generate step, and how it is called in the build step as if it were installed on the system.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan build .
