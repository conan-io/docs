.. _CMakeDeps:

CMakeDeps
=========


The ``CMakeDeps`` generator produces the necessary files for each dependency to be able to use the cmake
``find_package()`` function to locate the dependencies. It can be used like:


.. code-block:: python

    from conans import ConanFile

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        requires = "hello/0.1"
        generators = "CMakeDeps"


The full instantiation, that allows custom configuration can be done in the ``generate()`` method:


.. code-block:: python

    from conans import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeDeps

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        requires = "hello/0.1"

        def generate(self):
            cmake = CMakeDeps(self)
            cmake.generate()


.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: **CMakeLists.txt**
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
    project(compressor C)

    find_package(hello REQUIRED)

    add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} src/main.c)
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} hello::hello)


By default, for a ``hello`` requires, you need to use ``find_package(hello)`` and link with the target ``hello::hello``.
Check :ref:`the properties affecting CMakeDeps<CMakeDeps Properties>` like ``cmake_target_name`` to customize the file and
the target names in the conanfile.py of the dependencies and their components.


.. note::

    The ``CMakeDeps`` is intended to run with the ``CMakeToolchain`` generator. It will set ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` and
    ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` to the right folder (``conanfile.generators_folder``) so CMake can locate the generated config/module files.


Generated files
---------------

- **XXX-config.cmake**: By default, the CMakeDeps generator will create config files declaring the targets for the dependencies
  and their components (if declared).

- **FindXXX.cmake**: Only when the property ``cmake_find_mode`` is set by the dependency with "module" or "both". See :ref:`The properties affecting CMakeDeps<CMakeDeps Properties>` is set in the dependency.

- **Other necessary *.cmake**:  files like version, flags and directory data or configuration.


Customization
-------------

There are some attributes you can adjust in the created ``CMakeDeps`` object to change the default behavior:

configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Allows to define custom user CMake configuration besides the standard Release, Debug, etc ones.

.. code-block:: python

    def generate(self):
        deps = CMakeDeps(self)
        # By default, ``deps.configuration`` will be ``self.settings.build_type``
        if self.options["hello"].shared:
            # Assuming the current project ``CMakeLists.txt`` defines the ReleasedShared configuration.
            deps.configuration = "ReleaseShared"
        deps.generate()


build_context_activated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you have a **build-require**, by default, the config files (`xxx-config.cmake`) files are not generated.
But you can activate it using the **build_context_activated** attribute:

.. code-block:: python

    tool_requires = ["my_tool/0.0.1"]

    def generate(self):
        cmake = CMakeDeps(self)
        # generate the config files for the tool require
        cmake.build_context_activated = ["my_tool"]
        cmake.generate()


build_context_suffix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you have the same package as a **build-require** and as a **regular require** it will cause a conflict in the generator
because the file names of the config files will collide as well as the targets names, variables names etc.

For example, this is a typical situation with some requirements (capnproto, protobuf...) that contain
a tool used to generate source code at build time (so it is a **build_require**),
but also providing a library to link to the final application, so you also have a **regular require**.
Solving this conflict is specially important when we are cross-building because the tool
(that will run in the building machine) belongs to a different binary package than the library, that will "run" in the
host machine.

You can use the **build_context_suffix** attribute to specify a suffix for a requirement,
so the files/targets/variables of the requirement in the build context (tool require) will be renamed:

.. code-block:: python

    tool_requires = ["my_tool/0.0.1"]
    requires = ["my_tool/0.0.1"]

    def generate(self):
        cmake = CMakeDeps(self)
        # generate the config files for the tool require
        cmake.build_context_activated = ["my_tool"]
        # disambiguate the files, targets, etc
        cmake.build_context_suffix = {"my_tool": "_BUILD"}
        cmake.generate()



build_context_build_modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Also there is another issue with the **build_modules**. As you may know, the recipes of the requirements can declare a
`cppinfo.build_modules` entry containing one or more **.cmake** files.
When the requirement is found by the cmake ``find_package()``
function, Conan will include automatically these files.

By default, Conan will include only the build modules from the
``host`` context (regular requires) to avoid the collision, but you can change the default behavior.

Use the **build_context_build_modules** attribute to specify require names to include the **build_modules** from
**tool_requires**:

.. code-block:: python

    tool_requires = ["my_tool/0.0.1"]

    def generate(self):
        cmake = CMakeDeps(self)
        # generate the config files for the tool require
        cmake.build_context_activated = ["my_tool"]
        # Choose the build modules from "build" context
        cmake.build_context_build_modules = ["my_tool"]
        cmake.generate()

.. _CMakeDeps Properties:

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

The following properties affect the CMakeDeps generator:

- **cmake_file_name**: The config file generated for the current package will follow the ``<VALUE>-config.cmake`` pattern,
  so to find the package you write ``find_package(<VALUE>)``.
- **cmake_target_name**: Name of the target to be consumed.
- **cmake_target_aliases**: List of aliases that Conan will create for an already existing target.
- **cmake_find_mode**: Defaulted to ``config``. Possible values are:

  - ``config``: The CMakeDeps generator will create config scripts for the dependency.
  - ``module``: Will create module config (FindXXX.cmake) scripts for the dependency.
  - ``both``: Will generate both config and modules.
  - ``none``: Won't generate any file. It can be used, for instance, to create a system wrapper package so the consumers find the config files in the CMake installation config path and not in the generated by Conan (because it has been skipped).

- **cmake_module_file_name**: Same as **cmake_file_name** but when generating modules with ``cmake_find_mode=module/both``. If not specified it will default to **cmake_file_name**.
- **cmake_module_target_name**: Same as **cmake_target_name**  but when generating modules with ``cmake_find_mode=module/both``.  If not specified it will default to **cmake_target_name**.
- **cmake_build_modules**: List of ``.cmake`` files (route relative to root package folder) that are automatically
  included when the consumer run the ``find_package()``.
- **cmake_set_interface_link_directories**: boolean value that should be only used by dependencies that don't declare `self.cpp_info.libs` but have ``#pragma comment(lib, "foo")`` (automatic link) declared at the public headers. Those dependencies should
  add this property to their *conanfile.py* files at root ``cpp_info`` level (components not supported for now).

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def package_info(self):
        ...
        # MyFileName-config.cmake
        self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_file_name", "MyFileName")
        # Names for targets are absolute, Conan won't add any namespace to the target names automatically
        self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_target_name", "Foo::Foo")

        # Create a new target "MyFooAlias" that is an alias to the "Foo::Foo" target
        self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_target_aliases", ["MyFooAlias"])

        self.cpp_info.components["mycomponent"].set_property("cmake_target_name", "Foo::Var")
        # Automatically include the lib/mypkg.cmake file when calling find_package()
        self.cpp_info.components["mycomponent"].set_property("cmake_build_modules", [os.path.join("lib", "mypkg.cmake")])

        # Create a new target "VarComponent" that is an alias to the "Foo::Var" component target
        self.cpp_info.components["mycomponent"].set_property("cmake_target_aliases", ["VarComponent"])

        # Skip this package when generating the files for the whole dependency tree in the consumer
        # note: it will make useless the previous adjustements.
        # self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_find_mode", "none")

        # Generate both MyFileNameConfig.cmake and FindMyFileName.cmake
        self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_find_mode", "both")
