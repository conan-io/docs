PremakeDeps
===========

.. include:: ../../../common/experimental_warning.inc

The ``PremakeDeps`` is the dependencies generator for Premake.
The generator can be used by name in conanfiles:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conanfile.py

    class Pkg(ConanFile):
        generators = "PremakeDeps"


.. code-block:: text
    :caption: conanfile.txt

    [generators]
    PremakeDeps

And it can also be fully instantiated in the conanfile ``generate()`` method:

.. code:: python

    from conan import ConanFile
    from conan.tools.premake import PremakeDeps

    class App(ConanFile):
        settings = "os", "arch", "compiler", "build_type"
        requires = "zlib/1.2.11"

        def generate(self):
            deps = PremakeDeps(self)
            deps.generate()

.. important::

    The ``PremakeDeps`` generator must be used in conjunction with the
    :ref:`PremakeToolchain <conan_tools_premake_premaketoolchain>` generator, as it will
    generate a ``include('conandeps.premake5.lua')`` that will be automatically
    included by the toolchain.

Generated files
---------------

``PremakeDeps`` will generate a ``conandeps.premake5.lua`` script file which
will be injected later by the toolchain and the following files per dependency in the ``conanfile.generators_folder``:

- ``conan_<pkg>.premake5.lua``: will be including the proper script depending on the ``build_type`` and architecture.

- ``conan_<pkg>_vars_<config>.premake5.lua``: will contain essentially the following information for the specific dependency, architecture and build_type:

   - ``includedirs``
   - ``libdirs``
   - ``bindirs``
   - ``sysincludedirs``
   - ``frameworkdirs``
   - ``frameworks``
   - ``libs``
   - ``syslibs``
   - ``defines``
   - ``cxxflags``
   - ``cflags``
   - ``sharedlinkflags``
   - ``exelinkflags``

All this information will be loaded in the ``conandeps.premake5.lua`` script
and injected later to the main premake script, allowing a transparent and easy to use dependency management with conan.
