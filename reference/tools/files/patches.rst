=========================

.. _conan_tools_files_patch:

conan.tools.files.patch()
-------------------------

.. currentmodule:: conan.tools.files.patches

.. autofunction:: patch


Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan.tools.files import patch

    def build(self):
        for it in self.conan_data.get("patches", {}).get(self.version, []):

.. _conan_tools_files_apply_conandata_patches:

conan.tools.files.apply_conandata_patches()
-------------------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: conan.tools.files.patches

.. autofunction:: apply_conandata_patches

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan.tools.files import apply_conandata_patches

    def build(self):
        apply_conandata_patches(self)


Examples of ``conandata.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    patches:
    - patch_file: "patches/0001-buildflatbuffers-cmake.patch"
    - patch_file: "patches/0002-implicit-copy-constructor.patch"

      patch_type: backport
      patch_source: https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/pull/5650
      patch_description: Needed to build with modern clang compilers.

With different patches for different versions:

        - patch_file: "patches/0001-buildflatbuffers-cmake.patch"

For each patch, a ``patch_file``, a ``patch_string`` or a ``patch_user`` field must be provided. The first two are automatically applied by ``apply_conandata_patches()``, while ``patch_user`` are ignored, and must be handled by the user directly in the ``conanfile.py`` recipe.


conan.tools.files.export_conandata_patches()
--------------------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: conan.tools.files.patches

.. autofunction:: export_conandata_patches

Example of ``conandata.yml`` without versions defined:

.. code-block:: python

    from conan.tools.files import export_conandata_patches
    def export_sources(self):
        export_conandata_patches(self)


core.sources.patch:extra_path
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``export_conandata_patches()`` tool can automatically inject patches from an external path at package creation time
using the ``core.sources.patch:extra_path`` core configuration.

That means that ``conan create`` commands in ``conan-center-index`` repository could inject and apply patches without 
necessarily putting the patches in the same repository and without modifying the ``conandata.yml`` files.

The ``core.sources.patch:extra_path`` configuration should point to a folder containing all possible extra patches
for all possible packages, structured by package name, following the same conventions as ``conan-center-index`` repository:

.. code-block:: text

    extra_folder
        pkgname1
           conandata.yml
           patches
              mypatch.path
        pkgname2
           ...

The ``conandata.yml`` should also follow the same structure:

.. code-block:: yaml

    patches:
        "1.0":
            - patch_file: "patches/mypatch.patch"


.. note:: 

    It is impossible to apply patches to arbitrary dependencies when installing them (``conan install --build=xxx``), as the
    possible injected patches are part of the "source" identity of the package, and must be represented in their recipe revision.
    Already existing packages in the cache or in the remote servers have already exported its files and computed a recipe revision,
    so patches cannot be applied there without violating the identity (and as such the reproducibility and traceability) of packages.
    As a conclusion, it means that ``core.sources.patch:extra_path`` can only work at ``conan create`` time.
