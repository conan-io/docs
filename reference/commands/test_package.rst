conan test_package
==================

.. code-block:: bash

	$  conan test_package [-h] [-ne] [-f FOLDER] [--keep-source]
                            [--manifests [MANIFESTS]]
                            [--manifests-interactive [MANIFESTS_INTERACTIVE]]
                            [--verify [VERIFY]] [--update] [--scope SCOPE]
                            [--profile PROFILE] [-r REMOTE] [--options OPTIONS]
                            [--settings SETTINGS] [--env ENV]
                            [--build [BUILD [BUILD ...]]]
                            [path]




The ``test_package`` (previously named **test**) command looks for a **test_package subfolder** in the current directory, and builds the
project that is in it. It will typically be a project with a single requirement, pointing to
the ``conanfile.py`` being developed in the current directory.

This was mainly intended to do a test of the package, not to run unit or integrations tests on the package
being created. Those tests could be launched if desired in the ``build()`` method.
But it can be used for that purpose if desired, there are no real technical constraints.

The command line arguments are exactly the same as the settings, options, and build parameters
for the ``install`` command, with one small difference:

In conan test, by default, the ``--build=CurrentPackage`` pattern is automatically appended for the
current tested package. You can always manually specify other build options, like ``--build=never``,
if you just want to check that the current existing package works for the test subproject, without
re-building it.

You can use the ``conan new`` command with the ``-t`` option to generate a ``test_package`` skeleton.


.. code-block:: bash

    positional arguments:
        path                  path to conanfile file, e.g. /my_project/

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -ne, --not-export     Do not export the conanfile before test execution
      -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                            alternative test folder name, by default is
                            "test_package"
      --keep-source, -k     Optional. Do not remove the source folder in local
                            cache. Use for testing purposes only
      --manifests [MANIFESTS], -m [MANIFESTS]
                            Install dependencies manifests in folder for later
                            verify. Default folder is .conan_manifests, but can be
                            changed
      --manifests-interactive [MANIFESTS_INTERACTIVE], -mi [MANIFESTS_INTERACTIVE]
                            Install dependencies manifests in folder for later
                            verify, asking user for confirmation. Default folder
                            is .conan_manifests, but can be changed
      --verify [VERIFY], -v [VERIFY]
                            Verify dependencies manifests against stored ones
      --update, -u          check updates exist from upstream remotes
      --scope SCOPE, -sc SCOPE
                            Use the specified scope in the install command
      --profile PROFILE, -pr PROFILE
                            Apply the specified profile to the install command
      -r REMOTE, --remote REMOTE
                            look in the specified remote server
      --options OPTIONS, -o OPTIONS
                            Options to build the package, overwriting the
                            defaults. e.g., -o with_qt=true
      --settings SETTINGS, -s SETTINGS
                            Settings to build the package, overwriting the
                            defaults. e.g., -s compiler=gcc
      --env ENV, -e ENV     Environment variables that will be set during the
                            package build, -e CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
      --build [BUILD [BUILD ...]], -b [BUILD [BUILD ...]]
                            Optional, use it to choose if you want to build from
                            sources: --build Build all from sources, do not use
                            binary packages. --build=never Default option. Never
                            build, use binary packages or fail if a binary package
                            is not found. --build=missing Build from code if a
                            binary package is not found. --build=outdated Build
                            from code if the binary is not built with the current
                            recipe or when missing binary package.
                            --build=[pattern] Build always these packages from
                            source, but never build the others. Allows multiple
                            --build parameters.



If you want to use a different folder name than **test_package**, just use it and pass it to the ``-f folder``
command line option

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan test_package --f my_test_folder


This command will run the equivalent to ``conan export <user>/<channel>`` where ``user`` and ``channel``
will be deduced from the values of the requirement in the ``conanfile.py`` inside the test subfolder.
This is very convenient, as if you are running a package test it is extremely likely that you have
just edited the package recipe. If the package recipe is locally modified, it has to be exported again,
otherwise, the package will be tested with the old recipe. If you want to inhibit this ``export``,
you can use the ``-ne, --no-export`` parameter.
