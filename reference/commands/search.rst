conan search
============

.. code-block:: bash

	$ conan search [-r REMOTE] [pattern]

Search both package recipes and package binaries in the local cache or in a remote server.
If you provide a pattern, then it will search for existing package recipes matching that pattern.

You can search in a remote or in the local cache, if nothing is specified, the local conan cache is
assumed.

.. code-block:: bash

	positional arguments:
	  pattern               Pattern name, e.g. openssl/* or package recipe
	                        reference if "-q" is used. e.g.
	                        MyPackage/1.2@user/channel

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --case-sensitive      Make a case-sensitive search
	  -r REMOTE, --remote REMOTE
	                        Remote origin
	  -q QUERY, --query QUERY
	                        Packages query: "os=Windows AND (arch=x86 OR
	                        compiler=gcc)". The "pattern" parameter has to be a
	                        package recipe reference: MyPackage/1.2@user/channel

**Examples**


.. code-block:: bash

	$ conan search OpenCV/*
	$ conan search OpenCV/* -r=conan.io


If you use instead the full package recipe reference, you can explore the binaries existing for
that recipe, also in a remote or in the local conan cache:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search Boost/1.60.0@lasote/stable

A query syntax is allowed to look for specific binaries, you can use ``AND`` and ``OR`` operators and parenthesis, with settings and also options.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search Boost/1.60.0@lasote/stable -q arch=x86_64
    $ conan search Boost/1.60.0@lasote/stable -q "(arch=x86_64 OR arch=ARM) AND (build_type=Release OR os=Windows)"


If you specify a query filter for a setting and the package recipe is not restricted by this setting, will find all packages:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyRecipe(ConanFile):
        settings="arch"


.. code-block:: bash

    $ conan search MyRecipe/1.0@lasote/stable -q os=Windows


The query above will find all the ``MyRecipe`` binary packages, because the recipe doesn't declare "os" as a setting.
