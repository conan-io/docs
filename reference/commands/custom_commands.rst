Custom commands
=================

It's possible to create your own Conan commands to solve self-needs thanks to Python and Conan public API powers altogether.

Location and naming
--------------------

All the custom commands must be located in ``[YOUR_CONAN_HOME]/extensions/commands/`` folder. If you don't know where
``[YOUR_CONAN_HOME]`` is located, you can run :command:`conan config home` to check it.

If _commands_ sub-directory is not created yet, you will have to create it. Those custom commands files must be Python
files and start with the prefix ``cmd_[your_command_name].py``. The call to the custom commands is like any other
existing Conan one: :command:`conan your_command_name`.


Scoping
++++++++++

It's possible to have another folder layer to group some commands under the same topic.

For instance:

.. code-block:: text

    | - [YOUR_CONAN_HOME]/extensions/commands/greet/
          | - cmd_hello.py
          | - cmd_bye.py

The call to those commands change a little bit: :command:`conan [topic_name]:your_command_name`. Following the previous example:

.. code-block:: text

    $ conan greet:hello
    $ conan greet:bye


.. note::

    It's possible for only one folder layer, so it won't work to have something like
    ``[YOUR_CONAN_HOME]/extensions/commands/topic1/topic2/cmd_command.py``


Decorators
-----------

conan_command(group=None, formatters=None)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Main decorator to declare a function as a new Conan command. Where the parameters are:

* ``group`` is the name of the group of commands declared under the same name.
  This grouping will appear executing the :command:`conan -h` command.
* ``formatters`` is a dict-like Python object where the ``key`` is the formatter name and the value is the
  function instance where will be processed the information returned by the command one.


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: cmd_hello.py

    import json

    from conan.api.conan_api import ConanAPIV2
    from conans.cli.command import conan_command
    from conans.cli.output import ConanOutput


    def output_json(msg):
        return json.dumps({"greet": msg})


    @conan_command(group="Custom commands", formatters={"json": output_json})
    def hello(conan_api: ConanAPIV2, parser, *args):
        """
        Simple command to print "Hello World!" line
        """
        msg = "Hello World!"
        ConanOutput().info(msg)
        return msg


.. important::

    The function decorated by ``@conan_command(....)`` must have the same name as the suffix used by the Python file.
    For instance, the previous example, the file name is ``cmd_hello.py``, and the command function decorated is ``def hello(....)``.


conan_subcommand(formatters=None)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Similar to ``conan_command``, but this one is declaring a sub-command of an existing custom command. For instance:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: cmd_hello.py

    from conan.api.conan_api import ConanAPIV2
    from conans.cli.command import conan_command, conan_subcommand
    from conans.cli.output import ConanOutput


    @conan_subcommand()
    def hello_moon(conan_api, parser, subparser, *args):
        """
        Sub-command of "hello" that prints "Hello Moon!" line
        """
        ConanOutput().info("Hello Moon!")


    @conan_command(group="Custom commands")
    def hello(conan_api: ConanAPIV2, parser, *args):
        """
        Simple command "hello"
        """

The command call looks like :command:`conan hello moon`.

.. note::

    Notice that to declare a sub-command is required an empty Python function acts as the main command.


Command function arguments
----------------------------

These are the passed arguments to any custom command and its sub-commands functions:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: cmd_command.py

    from conans.cli.command import conan_command, conan_subcommand


    @conan_subcommand()
    def command_subcommand(conan_api, parser, subparser, *args):
        """
        subcommand information. This info will appear on ``conan command subcommand -h``.

        :param conan_api: <object conan.api.conan_api.ConanAPIV2> instance
        :param parser: root <object argparse.ArgumentParser> instance (coming from main command)
        :param subparser: <object argparse.ArgumentParser> instance for sub-command
        :param args: ``list`` of all the arguments passed after sub-command call
        :return: (optional) whatever is returned will be passed to formatters functions (if declared)
        """
        # ...


    @conan_command(group="Custom commands")
    def command(conan_api, parser, *args):
        """
        command information. This info will appear on ``conan command -h``.

        :param conan_api: <object conan.api.conan_api.ConanAPIV2> instance
        :param parser: root <object argparse.ArgumentParser> instance
        :param args: ``list`` of all the arguments passed after command call
        :return: (optional) whatever is returned will be passed to formatters functions (if declared)
        """
        # ...


* ``conan_api``: instance of ``ConanAPIV2`` class. See more about it in :ref:`conan.api.conan_api.ConanAPIV2 section<reference_python_api_conan_api_v2>`
* ``parser``: root instance of Python ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` class to be used by the main command function. See more information
  in `argparse official website <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html>`_.
* ``subparser`` (only for sub-commands): child instance of Python ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` class for each sub-command function.
* ``*args``: list of all the arguments passed via command line to be parsed and used inside the command function.
  Normally, they'll be parsed as ``args = parser.parse_args(*args)``. For instance, running :command:`conan mycommand arg1 arg2 arg3`,
  the command function will receive them as a Python list-like ``["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]``.
