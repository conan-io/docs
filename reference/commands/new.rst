conan new
=========

Create a new recipe (with a conanfile.py and other associated files) from either a predefined or a user-defined template.

conan new
---------

.. code-block:: text

    $ conan new -h
    usage: conan new [-h] [-v [V]] [-d DEFINE] [-f] template

    Create a new example recipe and source files from a template.

    positional arguments:
      template              Template name, either a predefined built-in or a user-
                            provided one. Available built-in templates: basic,
                            cmake_lib, cmake_exe, meson_lib, meson_exe,
                            msbuild_lib, msbuild_exe, bazel_lib, bazel_exe,
                            autotools_lib, autotools_exe. E.g. 'conan new
                            cmake_lib -d name=hello -d version=0.1'. You can
                            define your own templates too by inputting an absolute
                            path as your template, or a path relative to your
                            conan home folder.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v [V]                Level of detail of the output. Valid options from less
                            verbose to more verbose: -vquiet, -verror, -vwarning,
                            -vnotice, -vstatus, -v or -vverbose, -vv or -vdebug,
                            -vvv or -vtrace
      -d DEFINE, --define DEFINE
                            Define a template argument as key=value, e.g., -d
                            name=mypkg
      -f, --force           Overwrite file if it already exists


The ``conan new`` command creates a new recipe in the current working directory,
plus extra example files such as *CMakeLists.txt* or the *test_package* folder (as necessary),
to either be used as a basis for your own project or aiding in the debugging process.

Note that each template has some required and some [optional] user-defined variables used to customize the resulting files.

The available templates are:

- **basic**:
  Creates a simple recipe with some example code and helpful comments,
  and is a good starting point to avoid writing boilerplate code.

  Its variables are: [name], [version], [description], [require, require...]

- **alias**:
  Creates the minimal recipe needed to define an alias to a target recipe

  Its variables are: name, [version], target

- **cmake_lib**:
  Creates a cmake library target that defines a function called ``name``,
  which will print some information about the compilation environment to stdout.
  You can add requirements to this template in the form of

  ``conan new cmake_lib -d name=ai -d version=1.0 -d requires=math/3.14 -d requires=magic/0.0``

  This will add requirements for both ``math/3.14`` and ``magic/0.0`` to the `requirements()` method,
  will add the necessary ``find_package``s in CMake, and add a call to ``math()`` and ``magic()``
  inside the generated ``ai()`` function.

  Its variables are: name, version, [require, require...]

- **cmake_exe**:
  Creates a cmake executable target that defines a function called ``name``,
  which will print some information about the compilation environment to stdout.
  You can add requirements to this template in the form of

  ``conan new cmake_exe -d name=game -d version=1.0 -d requires=math/3.14 -d requires=ai/1.0``

  This will add requirements for both ``math/3.14`` and ``ai/1.0`` to the `requirements()` method,
  will add the necessary ``find_package``s in CMake, and add a call to ``math()`` and ``ai()``
  inside the generated ``game()`` function.

  Its variables are: name, version, [require, require...]

- **autotools_lib**:
  Creates an Autotools library.

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``

- **autotools_exe**:
  Creates an Autotools executable

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``

- **bazel_lib**:
  **Bazel integration BazelDeps, BazelToolchain, Bazel is experimental**. 
  Creates a Bazel library.

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``

- **bazel_exe**:
  **Bazel integration BazelDeps, BazelToolchain, Bazel is experimental**.
  Creates a Bazel executable

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``

- **meson_lib**:
  Creates a Meson library.

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``

- **meson_exe**:
  Creates a Meson executable

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``

- **msbuild_lib**:
  Creates a MSBuild library.

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``

- **msbuild_exe**:
  Creates a MSBuild executable

  Its variables are: ``name``, ``version``


.. warning::

  The output of the predefined built-in templates is **not stable**. It might
  change in future releases to adapt to the latest tools or good practices.


Examples
--------

.. code-block:: text

    $ conan new basic


Generates a basic *conanfile.py* that does not implement any custom functionality

.. code-block:: text

    $ conan new basic -d name=mygame -d requires=math/1.0 -d requires=ai/1.3

Generates a *conanfile.py* for ``mygame`` that depends on the packages ``math/1.0`` and ``ai/1.3``


.. code-block:: text

    $ conan new cmake_exe -d name=game -d version=1.0 -d requires=math/3.14 -d requires=ai/1.0

Generates the necessary files for a CMake executable target.
This will add requirements for both ``math/3.14`` and ``ai/1.0`` to the ``requirements()`` method,
will add the necessary ``find_package`` in CMake, and add a call to ``math()`` and ``ai()``
inside the generated ``game()`` function.


Custom templates
----------------

There's also the possibility to create your own templates by passing a path to your template directory,
both as an absolute path, or relative to your Conan home folder. This directory should contain Jinja2 templates,
which will produce your desired template structure. You can use custom variables that will be needed to be passed
as ``name`` and ```version`` does, or use your custom variables.
