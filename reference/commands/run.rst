conan run
=========

.. autocommand::
    :command: conan run -h


The conan run command lets you directly execute a binary from a Conan package, automatically resolving and installing
all its dependencies. There’s no need to search for paths or manually activate environments: just pass the executable,
and Conan runs it.
