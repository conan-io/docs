A file named *conanbuildinfo.json* will be generated. It will contain the information about every dependency and the installed settings and options:

        "MY_ENV_VAR": "foo"

The generated ``conanbuildinfo.json`` file is a json file with the following keys:

dependencies
-------------

The dependencies is a list, with each item belonging to one dependency, and each one with the following keys:
- name
- version
- description
- rootpath
- sysroot
- include_paths, lib_paths, bin_paths, build_paths, res_paths
- libs
- defines, cflags, cppflags, sharedlinkflags, exelinkflags

Plese note it is an ordered list, not a map, and dependency order is relevant. Upstream dependencies, i.e. the
ones that do not depend on other packages, will be first, and their direct dependencies after them, and so on.


deps_env_info
-------------

The environment variables defined by upstream dependencies

deps_user_info
--------------

The user variables defined by upstream dependencies

settings
--------

The settings used during `conan install`

options
-------

The options of each dependency
