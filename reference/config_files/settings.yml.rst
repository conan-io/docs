settings.yml
============

The input ``settings`` for packages in Conan are predefined in ``~/.conan/settings.yml`` file, so only a few like ``os`` or ``compiler``
are possible. These are the **default** values, but it is possible to customize them, see :ref:`custom_settings`.

As you can see, the possible values ``settings`` can take are restricted in the same file. This is done to ensure matching naming and
spelling as well as defining a common settings model among users and the OSS community.
If a setting is allowed to be set to any value, you can use ``ANY``.
If a setting is allowed to be set to any value or it can also be unset, you can use ``[None, ANY]``.

However, this configuration file can be modified to any needs, including new settings or subsettings and their values. If you want
to distribute a unified *settings.yml* file you can use the :ref:`conan config install command<conan_config_install>`.

.. note::

    The *settings.yml* file is not perfect nor definitive and surely incomplete. Please share any suggestion in the Conan issue tracker
    with any missing settings and values that could make sense for other users.

    To force the creation of the *settings.yml* the command ``conan config init`` is available.


Architectures
-------------

Here you can find a brief explanation of each of the architectures defined as ``arch``, ``arch_build`` and ``arch_target`` settings.

- **x86**: The popular 32 bit x86 architecture.

- **x86_64**: The popular 64 bit x64 architecture.

- **ppc64le**: The PowerPC 64 bit Big Endian architecture.

- **ppc32**: The PowerPC 32 bit architecture.

- **ppc64le**: The PowerPC 64 bit Little Endian architecture.

- **ppc64**: The PowerPC 64 bit Big Endian architecture.

- **armv5el**: The ARM 32 bit version 5 architecture, soft-float.

- **armv5hf**: The ARM 32 bit version 5 architecture, hard-float.

- **armv6**: The ARM 32 bit version 6 architecture.

- **armv7**: The ARM 32 bit version 7 architecture.

- **armv7hf**: The ARM 32 bit version 7 hard-float architecture.

- **armv7s**: The ARM 32 bit version 7 *swift* architecture mostly used in Apple's A6 and A6X chips on iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPad 4.

- **armv7k**: The ARM 32 bit version 7 *k* architecture mostly used in Apple's WatchOS.

- **armv8**: The ARM 64 bit and 32 bit compatible version 8 architecture. It covers only the ``aarch64`` instruction set.

- **armv8_32**: The ARM 32 bit version 8 architecture. It covers only the ``aarch32`` instruction set (a.k.a. ``ILP32``).

- **armv8.3**: The ARM 64 bit and 32 bit compatible version 8.3 architecture. Also known as ``arm64e``, it is used on the A12 chipset added
  in the latest iPhone models (XS/XS Max/XR).

- **sparc**: The SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) originally developed by Sun Microsystems.

- **sparcv9**: The SPARC version 9 architecture.

- **mips**: The 32 bit MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) developed by MIPS Technologies (formerly MIPS Computer
  Systems).

- **mips64**: The 64 bit MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) developed by MIPS Technologies (formerly MIPS Computer
  Systems).

- **avr**: The 8 bit AVR microcontroller architecture developed by Atmel (Microchip Technology).

- **s390**: The 32 bit address Enterprise Systems Architecture 390 from IBM.

- **s390x**: The 64 bit address Enterprise Systems Architecture 390 from IBM.

- **asm.js**: The subset of JavaScript that can be used as low-level target for compilers, not really a processor architecture, it's produced
  by Emscripten. Conan treats it as an architecture to align with build systems design (e.g. GNU auto tools and CMake).

- **wasm**: The Web Assembly, not really a processor architecture, but byte-code format for Web, it's produced by Emscripten. Conan treats it
  as an architecture to align with build systems design (e.g. GNU auto tools and CMake).

- **sh4le**: The Hitachi SH-4 SuperH architecture.

C++ standard libraries (aka compiler.libcxx)
--------------------------------------------

``compiler.libcxx`` sub-setting defines C++ standard libraries implementation to be used. The sub-setting applies only to certain compilers,
e.g. it applies to *clang*, *apple-clang* and *gcc*, but doesn't apply to *Visual Studio*.

- **libstdc++** (gcc, clang, apple-clang, sun-cc): `The GNU C++ Library <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/>`__. NOTE that this implicitly
  defines **_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0** to use old ABI. See :ref:`How to manage the GCC >= 5 ABI <manage_gcc_abi>` for the additional details. Might
  be a wise choice for old systems, such as CentOS 6. On Linux systems, you may need to install `libstdc++-dev <https://packages.debian.org/sid/libstdc++-dev>`_
  (package name could be different in various distros) in order to use the standard library. NOTE that on Apple systems usage of **libstdc++** has been deprecated.

- **libstdc++11** (gcc, clang, apple-clang): `The GNU C++ Library <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/>`__. NOTE that this implicitly
  defines **_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1** to use new ABI. See :ref:`How to manage the GCC >= 5 ABI <manage_gcc_abi>` for the additional details. Might
  be a wise choice for newer systems, such as Ubuntu 20. On Linux systems, you may need to install `libstdc++-dev <https://packages.debian.org/sid/libstdc++-dev>`_
  (package name could be different in various distros) in order to use the standard library. NOTE that on Apple systems usage of **libstdc++** has been deprecated.

- **libc++** (clang, apple-clang): `LLVM libc++ <https://libcxx.llvm.org/>`__. On Linux systems, you may need to install `libc++-dev <https://packages.debian.org/sid/libc++-dev>`_
  (package name could be different in various distros) in order to use the standard library.

- **c++_shared** (clang, Android only): use `LLVM libc++ <https://libcxx.llvm.org/>`__ as a shared library. Refer to the `C++ Library Support <https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support>`__ for the
  additiona details.

- **c++_static** (clang, Android only): use `LLVM libc++ <https://libcxx.llvm.org/>`__ as a static library. Refer to the `C++ Library Support <https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support>`__ for the
  additiona details.

- **libCstd** (sun-cc): Rogue Wave's stdlib. See `Comparing C++ Standard Libraries libCstd, libstlport, and libstdcxx <https://www.oracle.com/solaris/technologies/cmp-stlport-libcstd.html>`__.

- **libstlport** (sun-cc): `STLport <http://www.stlport.org/>`__. See `Comparing C++ Standard Libraries libCstd, libstlport, and libstdcxx <https://www.oracle.com/solaris/technologies/cmp-stlport-libcstd.html>`__.

- **libstdcxx** (sun-cc): `Apache C++ Standard Library <http://people.apache.org/~gmcdonald/stdcxx/index.html>`__. See `Comparing C++ Standard Libraries libCstd, libstlport, and libstdcxx <https://www.oracle.com/solaris/technologies/cmp-stlport-libcstd.html>`__.

- **gpp** (qcc): GNU C++ lib. See `QCC documentation <https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.5.0SP1.update/com.qnx.doc.neutrino_utilities/q/qcc.html>`__.
