conanfile.py
============

.. _package_url:

Package URL
-----------

It is possible, even typical if you are packaging a thid party lib, that you just develop
the packaging code. Such code is also subject to change and collaboration, so it should be stored
in VCS as git, and probably put in GitHub or the like. If you do so, please indicate it in the
``url`` attribute, so it can be easily found.
 
.. code-block:: python

   class HelloConan(ConanFile):
       name = "Hello"
       version = "0.1"
       url = "https://github.com/memsharded/hellopack.git"
     
           
The ``url`` is the url
**of the package** repository, i.e. not necessarily the original source code.
It is optional, but very recommended, should point to GitHub, Bitbucket or your preferred
code collaboration platform. Of course, if you have the conanfile inside your library source,
you can point to it, and afterward use the ``url`` in your ``source()`` method.

.. _retrieve_source:

Retrieving source code
----------------------

There are 2 ways of getting source code to build a package. The first one is to use the ``export``
field, where you specify which sources are required, and they will be exported together with
the **conanfile.py**, and stored in the conan stores, both local and remotes.

The other way is let conan retrieve the source code from any other external origin, github, or
just a regular download. This can be done in the ``source()`` method.

For example, in the previous section, we "exported" the source code files together with the **conanfile.py** file,
which can be handy if the source code is not under version control. But if the source code is
available in a repository, you can directly get it from there:

.. code-block:: python

   from conans import ConanFile

   class HelloConan(ConanFile):
       name = "Hello"
       version = "0.1"
       settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
       # exports = "hello/*"
   
       def source(self):
           self.run("git clone https://github.com/memsharded/hello.git")
           # You can also change branch, commit or whatever
           # self.run("cd hello && git checkout 2fe5...")


This will work as long as ``git`` is in your current path (so in Win you probably want to run in msysgit, cmder, etc).
You can also use other VCS or direct download/unzip. For that purpose we have provided some helpers,
but you can also use your own code or origin. This is a snippet of the conanfile of the POCO libray:


..  code-block:: python

   from conans import ConanFile
   from conans.tools import download, unzip, check_md5, check_sha1, check_sha256
   import os
   import shutil

   class PocoConan(ConanFile):
       name = "Poco"
       version = "1.6.0"

       def source(self):
           zip_name = "poco-1.6.0-release.zip"
           download("https://github.com/pocoproject/poco/archive/poco-1.6.0-release.zip", zip_name)
           # check_md5(zip_name, "51e11f2c02a36689d6ed655b6fff9ec9")
           # check_sha1(zip_name, "8d87812ce591ced8ce3a022beec1df1c8b2fac87")
           # check_sha256(zip_name, "653f983c30974d292de58444626884bee84a2731989ff5a336b93a0fef168d79")
           unzip(zip_name)
           shutil.move("poco-poco-1.6.0-release", "poco")
           os.unlink(zip_name)
           
The download, unzip utilities can be imported from conan, but you can also use your own code here
to retrieve source code from any origin. For pre-compiled libraries you have, even if you
dont have the source code, you can create the package. You can download the binaries here, skip
the ``build()`` method and define your ``package()`` and ``package_info()`` accordingly.

You can also use **check_md5**, **check_sha1** and **check_sha256** from module **tools** to verify that package is downloaded right.



Configuration
-------------

There are several things that can potentially affect the package being created, i.e., the final
package will be different (a different binay, for example), if some input is different.

Settings
++++++++
Development project-wide variables as the compiler, the compiler version, or the OS 
itself. Those variables have to be defined, and they cannot have a default value defined in the
conanfile, as it does not make sense.

It is obvious that changing OS produces in most cases a different binary. Also changing compiler
or compiler version changes the binary too, which might have a compatible ABI or not, but the
package is indeed different.

But what happens for example to **header only libraries?** Such libraries final package is not
binary, and in most cases, unless it is automatically generating code, the final package will
be the same. We can indicate that in the conanfile:

.. code-block:: python

   from conans import ConanFile

   class HelloConan(ConanFile):
       name = "Hello"
       version = "0.1"
       # We can just omit the settings attribute too
       settings = None
       
       def build(self):
            #empty too, nothing to build in header only
         
         
You can as well restrict existing settings, or accepted values, by redeclaring the settings
attribute:

.. code-block:: python

   class HelloConan(ConanFile):
      settings = {"os": ["Windows"],
                  "compiler": {"Visual Studio": {"version": [11, 12]}},
                  "arch": None}
                  
In this example we have just defined that this package only works in Windows, with VS 10 and 11.
Any attempt to build it in other platforms with other settings will throw an error saying so.
We have also defined that the runtime (the MD, MT flags of VS) is not relevant for us
(maybe using a universal one?). Using None as a value means, *leave the original values* in order
to avoid re-typing them. Then, "arch": None is totally equivalent to "arch": ["x86", "x86_64", "arm"]
Check the reference or your ~/.conan/settings.yml file.

As re-defining the whole settings attribute can be tedious, it is sometimes much simpler to
remove or tune specific fields in the ``config()`` method. E.g.: if our package is runtime
independent in VS, we can just remove that setting field:


.. code-block:: python
   
   settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
   
   def config(self):
       self.settings.compiler["Visual Studio"].remove("runtime")
       
       
Options
+++++++
Options are similar to settings in the sense that they influence the final package. But they
can typically have a default value. A very typical case would be the static/shared option of 
a compiled library, which could be defined as:


.. code-block:: python
   
   class HelloConan(ConanFile):
      ...
      options = {"static": [True, False]}
      default_options = "static=True"
   
      def build(self):
         static = "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON" if not self.options.static else ""
         cmake = CMake(self.settings)
         self.run("cmake . %s %s" % (cmake.command_line, static))
         self.run("cmake --build . %s" % cmake.build_config)
         
Note that you have to consider the option properly in your build. In this case we are using
the CMake way. You must also remove the **STATIC** linkage in the **CMakeLists.txt** file, 
and if you are using VS, you also need to change your code to adequately import/export symbols
for the dll.


Variable configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++
If the package options and settings are related, and you want to configure one or the other, you
can do it in the ``config()`` method. This is an example:

..  code-block:: python

   class MyLibConan(ConanFile):
       name = "MyLib"
       version = "2.5"
       settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
       options = {"static": [True, False], 
                   "header_only": [True False]}

       def config(self):
           # If header only, the compiler, etc, does not affect the package!
           if self.options.header_only:
               self.settings.clear()
               self.options.remove("static")

The package has 2 options, to be compiled as static (vs shared lib), and also creating a package
without building anything at all, cause just header-only libs will be used. In this case,
the settings that would affect a normal building, and even the other option (static vs shared)
does not make sense, so we just clear those. That means, if someone consume MyLib with the
``header_only: True``, then the package downloaded and used will be the same, irrespective of
the OS, compiler or architecture the consumer is building with.


Generators
----------

Generators specify which is the output of the ``install`` command in your project folder. By
default, a ``conanbuildinfo.txt`` is generated, but you can specify different generators:

- gcc: conanbuildinfo.gcc
- cmake: conanbuildinfo.cmake
- txt: conanbuildinfo.txt

You can specify more than one:

.. code-block:: python

   class MyLibConan(ConanFile):
       generators = "cmake", "gcc"


Requirements
------------

Specify package dependencies as a list of other packages:


.. code-block:: python

   class MyLibConan(ConanFile):
       requires = "Hello/1.0@user/stable", "OtherLib/2.1@otheruser/testing"

You can specify further information about the package requirements:

.. code-block:: python

   class MyLibConan(ConanFile):
      requires = (("Hello/0.1@user/testing"),
                  ("Say/0.2@dummy/stable", "override"),
                  ("Bye/2.1@coder/beta", "private"))

Requirements can be complemented by 2 different parameters:

**private**: a dependency can be declared as private if it is going to be fully embedded and hidden
from consumers of the package. Typical examples could be a header only library which is not exposed
through the public interface of the package, or the linking of a static library inside a dynamic
one, in which the functionality or the objects of the linked static one is not exposed through
the public interface of the dynamic library.

**override**: a package can define overrides of their dependencies, if they want to define specific
versions of the upstream required libraries, but not necessarly direct dependencies. For example, 
you can depend on A(v1.0), which in turn could conditionally depend on Zlib(v2), depending whether
the compression is enabled or not. Now, if you want to force the usage of Zlib(v3) you can:

..  code-block:: python

   class HelloConan(ConanFile):
      requires = ("A/1.0@user/stable", ("Zlib/3.0@other/beta", "override"))
      

This **will not introduce a new dependency**, it will just change Zlib v2 to v3 if A actually
requires it, otherwise Zlib will not be a dependency of your package


Besides the ``requires`` field, more advanced requirement logic can be defined in the
``requirements()`` optional method, using for example values from the package ``settings`` or
``options``:


..  code-block:: python

   def requirements(self):
        if self.options.myoption:
            self.requires("zlib/1.2@drl/testing")
        else:
            self.requires("opencv/2.2@drl/stable")

This is a powerful mechanism to handle **conditional dependencies**.

When you are inside the method, each call to ``self.requires()`` will add such requirement to 
the current list of requirements. It has also optional parameters that allow to define the 
special cases, similar to the above syntax:

..  code-block:: python

   def requirements(self):
        self.requires("zlib/1.2@drl/testing", private=True, override=False)

System requirements
-------------------
It is possible to install system-wide packages from conan, just add a ``system_requirements()``
method to your conanfile and specify there what you need:

..  code-block:: python

    def system_requirements(self):
        if platform.system() == "Linux": # Further check for debian based missing
            self.run("sudo apt-get install mysystemdeps")
        else:
            # ...
        return "Installed mysystemdeps"

Conan will keep track of the execution of this method, so it is not invoked again and again
at every conan command. The execution is done per package, as some packages of the same
lib might have different system dependencies. If you are sure all your binary packages
have the same system requirements, just add the following line to your method:

..  code-block:: python

    def system_requirements(self):
         self.global_system_requirements=True
         if ...


Testing (unit) your library
---------------------------
We have seen how to run package tests with conan, but what if we want to run our library full
unit tests before packaging? So they are run for every build configuration.
Nothing special is required here, you can just launch the tests as
the last command in your ``build()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   def build(self):
      cmake = CMake(self.settings)
      self.run("cmake . %s %s" % (cmake.command_line))
      self.run("cmake --build . %s" % cmake.build_config)
      # here you can run CTest, launch your binaries, etc
      self.run("ctest")
      
 
C++ build information
---------------------
Each package has to specify certain build information to its consumers. This can be done in
the ``cpp_info`` attribute within the ``package_info()`` method.

The ``cpp_info`` attribute has the following properties you can assign/append to:

.. code-block:: python

   self.cpp_info.includedirs = ['include']  # Ordered list of include paths
   self.cpp_info.libs = []  # The libs to link against
   self.cpp_info.libdirs = ['lib']  # Directories to find libraries
   self.cpp_info.resdirs = ['res']  # Directories to find resources, data, etc
   self.cpp_info.bindirs = []  # Directories to find executables and shared libs
   self.cpp_info.defines = []  # preprocessor definitions
   self.cpp_info.cflags = []  # pure C flags
   self.cpp_info.cppflags = []  # C++ compilation flags
   self.cpp_info.sharedlinkflags = []  # linker flags
   self.cpp_info.exelinkflags = []  # linker flags


* includedirs: list of relative paths (starting from the package root) of directories to find
  headers. By default it is initialize to ['include'], and it is rarely changed.
* libs: ordered list of libs the client should link against. Empty by default, it is common
  that different configurations produce different library names. For example:
  
.. code-block:: python
  
   def package_info(self):
        if not self.settings.os == "Windows":
            self.cpp_info.libs = ["libzmq-static.a"] if self.options.static else ["libzmq.so"]
        else:
            ...

* libdirs: list of relative paths (starting from the package root) of directories to find
  library object binaries (.lib, .a, .so. dylib). By default it is initialize to ['lib'], and it is rarely changed. 
* resdirs: list of relative paths (starting from the package root) of directories to find
  resource files (images, xml, etc). By default it is initialize to ['res'], and it is rarely changed. 
* bindirs: list of relative paths (starting from the package root) of directories to find
  library runtime binaries (as windows .dlls). By default it is initialize to ['bin'], and it is rarely changed. 
* defines: ordered list of preprocessor directives. It is common that the consumers have to specify
  some sort of defines in some case, so including the library headers matches the binaries:
* <c,cpp,exelink,sharedlink>flags, list of flags that the consumer should activate for proper
  behavior. Usage of C++11 could be here, for example, though it is true that the consumer may
  want to do some flag processing to check if different dependencies are setting incompatible flags
  (c++11 after c++14)
  
.. code-block:: python
  
   if self.options.static:
      if self.settings.compiler == "Visual Studio":
          self.cpp_info.libs.append("ws2_32")
      self.cpp_info.defines = ["ZMQ_STATIC"]

      if not self.settings.os == "Windows":
          self.cpp_info.cppflags = ["-pthread"]
           
            
        
Importing files
---------------
Importing files copies files living in the local store to your project. This feature is handy
for copying shared libraries (dylib in Mac, dll in Win) near your executable, so you dont have
to mess with your PATH to run them. But there are other use cases:

- Copy an executable to your project, so it can be easily run. A good example is the google
  **protobuf** code generator, go to the examples section to check it.
- Copy package data to your project. Configuration, images, sounds... A good example is the
  OpenCV demo, in which face detection XML pattern files are required.
  
Importing files is also very convenient in order to redistribute your application, as many times
you will just have to bundle your project bin folder.

A typical ``imports()`` method for shared libs could be:

.. code-block:: python

   def imports(self):
      self.copy("*.dll", "", "bin")
      self.copy("*.dylib", "", "lib")

Package information
-------------------
Each package will translate its settings, options and requirements to a unique sha1 signature.
A convention is established to define such mapping, but you might change it to your needs.
For example, you are building a pure C library with a certain compiler and version, so you
define the package to have the typical settings. But then you realize than every consumer
using a different compiler will try to depend on a different package, re-building it from
source if you didnt generate it. As the ABI is compatible, you might want to build just one package
with your preferred compiler version. You can *narrow* such setting as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   class MyLibConan(ConanFile):
       name = "MyLib"
       version = "2.5"
       settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
       
       def conan_info(self):
           self.info.settings.compiler.version = "Any"
           
Note that such setting can take any value, it is not subject to validation. You can notice that
we actually have 2 settings, the normal, "full" settings, as ``self.settings`` and another
under ``self.info.settings``. The latest is the one used to compute the sha1 signature and it is
initially a copy of the ``self.settings`` one.

Both are shown in the **conaninfo.txt** file, ``[settings]`` is the latest one, used to compute
the sha1, with the "Any" value, and ``[full_settings]`` is the former, the one passed as configuration, holding the actual
compiler version that has been used to create the package.

C++ ABI compatibility among different compiler and versions is not assumed, nor hardcoded.
g++ 4.8 will be generally considered different to g++ 4.9 and g++ 5.0. If you are sure your
package ABI compatibility is fine for versions 4.X, but changes with 5.0, you could try
something like:

.. code-block:: python
       
   def conan_info(self):
      v = self.settings.compiler.version
      if self.settings.compiler == "gcc" and (v == "4.8" or v == "4.9"):
         self.info.settings.compiler.version = "4.8-9"
   
This behavior can also be very useful if you want to specify compiler settings to be able to build
and run unit tests, but the library is actually header only. 

Similarly we can change the signature options (though this use case might be rare) and the
package requirements. For example, a typical **conaninfo.txt** requiring a stable dependency
could contain:


.. code-block:: text

   [requires]
       Hello/1.Y.Z
   
   [full_requires]
       Hello/1.1@demo/testing:73bce3fd7eb82b2eabc19fe11317d37da81afa56
       
This scheme asumes that changing the upstream Hello dependency, will not affect my package, as
long as the major version is not changed. Lets say that the "Hello" lib does not follow semver,
and it breaks binary compatibility in each minor release. Then, we should change our ``info``s
as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   def conan_info(self):
      hello_require = self.info.requires["Hello"]
      hello_require.version = hello_require.full_version.minor()
      
That will produce a **conaninfo.txt** file as:

.. code-block:: text

   [requires]
       Hello/1.1.Z
       
       
.. note::

   Remember that following semver, versions<1.0 (0.Y.Z) are considered unstable, so they will
   be included in the [requires] section as is, and influence the signature, forcing re-build
   of packages when upstream 0.Y.Z dependencies change, even for patches. Change it in your
   conan_info() method if you need.


Other
-----
There are some helpers in the conanfile for colored output and running commands:

..  code-block:: python

   self.output.info("This is a warning, should be yellow")
   self.output.warn("This is a warning, should be yellow")
   self.output.error("Error, should be red")
   self.output.rewrite_line("for progress bars, issues a cr")
   
Check the source code, you might be able to produce different outputs with different colors.


The ``self.run()`` is a helper to run system commands and throw exceptions on error, so command
errors are not passed without notice. It is just a wrapper for ``os.system()``
